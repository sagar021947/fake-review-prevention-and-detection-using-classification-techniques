B0027FFZEW	Plantronics Voyager PRO Bluetooth Headset	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories	Headsets	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41k-TRjUjwL._SX300_.jpg	"Recipient of 2010 iF Product Design Award &nbsp;The Plantronics Voyager PRO is a recipient of the 2010 iF Product Design Award for excellence in design quality, workmanship, choice of materials, degree of innovation,&nbsp;&nbsp; environmental friendliness, functionality, ergonomics, visualization of use, safety, brand value, branding and universal design. The award remains valid for the entire product lifecycle.Featuring the next-generation AudioIQ2 digital signal processing (DSP) technology, the Plantronics Voyager PRO delivers superior noise and wind cancellation as well as rich, natural inbound audio so you can hear and be heard clearly in virtually any noisy environment--from windy sidewalks to hectic airports. This comfortable, behind-the-ear headset features two noise-canceling mics on a boom, AudioIQ2 technology with its adaptive 20-band equalizer, and three layers of WindSmart technology. The pivoting mic boom lets you wear the headset on either ear and optimize the position of the two microphones. An automatic voice prompt alerts you to battery and mute status. It provides up to six hours of continuous talk time and five days of standby from single charge.AudioIQ2 and WindSmart TechnologiesWhile other headsets deliver noise cancellation at the expense of overall audio quality, Voyager PRO's AudioIQ2 technology and unique adjustable dual-microphone boom provide the advantage of capturing your voice close to your mouth so the AudioIQ2 technology can more effectively remove ambient noise, while still maintaining the natural sound of your voice.With its finely tuned adaptive 20-band equalizer, AudioIQ2 makes you sound like you're in the same room as your caller, not miles apart. To achieve this, AudioIQ2 makes use of two microphones--one that's focused on your speech and the other that picks out distracting background sounds, such as road hum and construction noise. It then compares the data from the two mics and eliminates the unwanted sounds, leaving your unique voice free to be heard clearly and naturally, as it was meant to be.The dual microphones are also stacked with three layers of WindSmart technology. Stainless steel mic screens, acoustic fabrics, and an electronic filter in the mic circuitry--all aggressively block intrusive wind noise. The adjustable boom, which allows you to wear the headset on either ear, positions the mics where they can best capture your voice, further enhancing the sound quality.See aschematic of the Voyager PRO's controls.The Voyager PRO features a soft silicone ear tip that's ideal for acoustics and an ergonomic fit; a durable, flexible rubber that's suitable for continuous skin contact; and even weight distribution across multiple touch points to help avoid fatigue.Engineered for Comfort and Your Mobile LifestyleThe Plantronics Voyager PRO endured 24 rounds of human factors testing to perfect the design for all-day wearing, comfort, and stability. The behind-the-ear wearing style is perfectly counterbalanced so weight is distributed evenly, rendering it virtually weightless when worn. The Voyager  PRO ear tip is made of soft silicone for an optimal fit and features a ""sound channel"" that helps distribute audio evenly to the ear.Designed with the mobile professional-user in mind, it includes easily accessible power, volume and mute buttons and features voice prompts for low battery warnings and mute status. Finally, the lithium polymer battery provides up to six hours of continuous talk time and five days of stand-by time, exceeding the talk and standby times of most mobile phones.SpecificationsBluetooth technology: Version 2.1+EDR (Enhanced Data Rate)Bluetooth profiles: Hands-free v1.5 (HFP), Headset v1.1 (HSP)Range: Up to 33 feet (10 meters)QuickPair technology: Supports initial pairing with Bluetooth phonesMultipoint technology: Supports an active connection with two Bluetooth devicesHeadset controls: Power on/off; volume up/down; call answer/end; mute function; quick battery check; call reject; last number redial*; voice-activated dialing* (*if supported by phone and phone provider)Voice prompts: Mute status on/off; battery status for low/recharge batteryBattery type: 3.5V Li-ion polymer rechargeableCharge connectors: Micro USB connector and AC/DC 100&acirc;&euro;""240VCharge time: 1.5 hours for full chargeWeight: 17.5 grams (0.62 ounces)Talk time: Up to 6 hoursStandby time: Up to 120 hours (5 days)Warranty: 1 year limited warrantyWhat's in the BoxVoyager PRO Bluetooth headset, AC wall/travel charger, three soft gel eartips, two foam eartip covers, and a printed user manual"	12986	Plantronics	96.00

Data charges from network operators may apply.Voice Guidance and Traffic InformationTurn-by-turn, voice guided navigation comes free for both drivers and pedestrians. For drivers this includes lane assistance, traffic information, safety camera, and speed warnings. For pedestrians, this includes shortcuts through parks and pedestrian-only zones for over 100 cities around the world as well as 6,000 3D landmarks in over 200 cities to help you find exactly where you are.Unique Hybrid TechnologyOvi Maps is built on an advanced technology called hybrid vector maps. Vector maps are high quality but less data intensive and allow you to continue to navigate even if you lose your network connection. This means that maps downloaded or updated across a network connection are about half the size of bulky bitmaps used by other mobile map providers. The hybrid technology ensures that, unlike other providers, any downloaded map data is stored on the device for future use.No Network Connection Required When NavigatingAvoid expensive, battery-draining network connections with Nokia's unique hybrid technology. Maps can be pre-loaded on to your Nokia smartphone so you can set Ovi Maps to offline mode, saving battery power, and the navigation system will still work. This is particularly useful for those worried about data connection costs when travelling abroad or when you are travelling through areas with little or no network coverage.Best Global CoverageYou take your mobile with you wherever you go in the world so, as standard, voice guided navigation for both pedestrians and drivers is available for 74 countries in 46 different languages and there are maps for over 180 countries. This gives you the best maps with the largest global coverage for free.Technical SpecificationsMusic playback file formats: AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, AMR-NB, WMAFM radio 87.5-108 MHz with RDS supportVideo playback file formats: .mp4, AVC/H.264, .wmv, RV, Flash Video, H.263/3GPPVideo streaming: .mp4, AVC/H.264, .wmv, RV, Flash Video, H.263/3GPPVideo recording file formats: .mp4 - default (VGA, QVGA) or .3gp (QCIF for MMS)3.5 mm Nokia audio connectorMicro-USB connector supports charging; USB PictBridge printingBluetooth 2.0 with Enhanced Data RateUPnP supportSupport for PC synchronization with Nokia PC Suite 7.1 (preinstalled) and Nokia Ovi SuiteE-mail supported protocols: IMAP4 (with idle), Nokia Messaging, Microsoft ActiveSync, POP3, SMTPSupport for Nokia Messaging service, Mail for Exchange, Lotus Notes Traveler"	91355	Nokia	190.00

Data charges from network operators may apply.Voice Guidance and Traffic InformationTurn-by-turn, voice guided navigation comes free for both drivers and pedestrians. For drivers this includes lane assistance, traffic information, safety camera, and speed warnings. For pedestrians, this includes shortcuts through parks and pedestrian-only zones for over 100 cities around the world as well as 6,000 3D landmarks in over 200 cities to help you find exactly where you are.Unique Hybrid TechnologyOvi Maps is built on an advanced technology called hybrid vector maps. Vector maps are high quality but less data intensive, and allow you to continue to navigate even if you lose your network connection. This means that maps downloaded or updated across a network connection are about half the size of bulky bitmaps used by other mobile map providers. The hybrid technology ensures that, unlike other providers, any downloaded map data is stored on the device for future use.No Network Connection Required When NavigatingAvoid expensive, battery-draining network connections with Nokia's unique hybrid technology. Maps can be pre-loaded on to your Nokia smartphone so you can set Ovi Maps to offline mode, saving battery power, and the navigation system will still work. This is particularly useful for those worried about data connection costs when travelling abroad, or when travelling through areas with little or no network coverage.Best Global CoverageYou take your mobile with you wherever you go in the world so, as standard, voice guided navigation for both pedestrians and drivers is available for 74 countries in 46 different languages, and there are maps for over 180 countries. This gives you the best maps with the largest global coverage for free."	33119	Nokia	190.00

No additional licenses needed for extra countries, regions or services like traffic information or city guides. Data charges from network operators may apply.Voice Guidance and Traffic InformationTurn-by-turn, voice guided navigation comes free for both drivers and pedestrians. For drivers this includes lane assistance, traffic information, safety camera, and speed warnings. For pedestrians, this includes shortcuts through parks and pedestrian-only zones for over 100 cities around the world as well as 6,000 3D landmarks in over 200 cities to help you find exactly where you are.Unique Hybrid TechnologyOvi Maps is built on an advanced technology called hybrid vector maps. Vector maps are high quality but less data intensive and allow you to continue to navigate even if you lose your network connection. This means that maps downloaded or updated across a network connection are about half the size of bulky bitmaps used by other mobile map providers. The hybrid technology ensures that, unlike other providers, any downloaded map data is stored on the device for future use.No Network Connection Required When NavigatingAvoid expensive, battery-draining network connections with Nokia's unique hybrid technology. Maps can be pre-loaded on to your Nokia smartphone so you can set Ovi Maps to offline mode, saving battery power, and the navigation system will still work. This is particularly useful for those worried about data connection costs when travelling abroad or when you are travelling through areas with little or no network coverage.Best Global CoverageYou take your mobile with you wherever you go in the world so, as standard, voice guided navigation for both pedestrians and drivers is available for 74 countries in 46 different languages and there are maps for over 180 countries. This gives you the best maps with the largest global coverage for free."	83282	Nokia	209.21

This product does not have a manufacturer warranty rather a 30-day return period with seller.\n\n\nAt just 9.3mm, the iPhone 4 is thin as a rake but the front and back are 30 times stronger than the usual plastic. Reason - aluminosilicate glass, the stuff that windshields of military choppers are made of. The periphery is customized alloy, 5 times stronger than steel. Your accidental dropping won't hurt your pocket-communicator. The Retina Display packs in 4 times the amount of pixels (326 per inch) of iPhone 3, and makes the text and images slicing sharp. Thanks to the added 960 x 640 pixel screen watching of HD movies on the iPhone 4 becomes a gasp. When you become a shutterbug behind the iPhone 4 camera, you shoot 5 megapixel images and high-definition videos at 720p resolution, with the LED flash and autofocus that make things easier. Opt for the iMovie video editing software, and you become a movie maker. If you happen to have Wi-Fi around, the FaceTime feature gets you into true worldwide video chat and 'staying in touch' becomes real personal. And all it takes to choose between the front and rear camera is a tap. The 3-axis gyro, when coupled with accelerometer, results in 6-axis motion sensing, and that's as good as it can ever get for gaming on a cell phone. With 7 hours of talk time (3G)/10 hours of video/40 hours of audio, the iPhone 4 packs in enough power to let you do fast multitasking."	1357	Apple	190.00

Measuring just 7.1mm in thickness, the Motorola RAZR is one of the thinnest smartphones on the market. Slimmer than the Samsung Galaxy S II and Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc, which are slim handsets anyway. The back of the device made with Kevlar (the material in bulletproof vests) fibre, to keep size and weight to a minimum but increase strength and rigidity in the phone. Corning Gorilla Glass protects the Super AMOLED Advanced screen that sits below it. Super strong, this glass will protect the device against scratches and scrapes that would normally damage any other display. The RAZR is coated with a nano technology which makes the device splash-proof. The powerful dual-core 1.2 GHz processor lets you act as fast as you can think (finally), while the 1GB of RAM keeps the momentum going. Capture the excitement of your own life with the 8MP rear camera and 1080p HD video recording, for crisp, clear, cinematic quality images. Your video captures will be especially smooth, thanks to technology that helps stabilize the camera. And, whether your next incoming call is about dissecting the play or landing the deal, see things eye-to-eye with the front-facing HD video camera. Whether you stream or download films, the hyper-vibrant colors of the Super AMOLED Advanced display make watching films on-the-go just as thrilling as watching at home on your HDTV. And zero motion-blur technology keeps the action smooth, so you can focus on the story."	12774	Motorola	190.00

The easy-to-install unit mounts conveniently in the wall, where its narrow footprint doesn't keep it from delivering powerful, high-performance sound for both movies and music. The speaker is particularly suited to front or center channel applications in a surround sound system thanks to its versatile three-driver design, which ensures that the lows, mids, and highs all receive ample attention. The NS-IW960's dual 6.5-inch Kevlar cone woofers, for instance, reproduce frequencies as low as 50 Hz--a solid number for an in-wall speaker. The 1-inch titanium dome tweeter, meanwhile, ranges as high as 28 kHz. The end result is warm, rich sound that transitions smoothly and seamlessly from bass-heavy passages to soaring vocal highs.Yamaha uses only high-quality materials when building the drivers to ensure superb sound quality from any source. And should you need to re-orient your listening area for any reason, the NS-IW960 stands ready to accommodate your new setup. The speaker's tweeter is built on an adjustable swivel, so you can ""aim"" the high-frequency sounds toward the new listening position. To do so, simply press on the edge of the tweeter until it reaches the correct angle.Finally, each speaker includes a high-capacity, customized crossover network at 6.5 kHz that helps minimize distortion and prevent the deterioration of transients as they pass through the network. And installation is straightforward thanks to the included cutout template, the paintable grille and frame, and the gold-plated push-type speaker terminals. Note that proper installation requires such tools as a power drill, a drywall saw, wire strippers, a level, a Philips screwdriver, and a sturdy wire such as a coat hanger.The speaker, which boasts a power rating of 50 watts nominal and 150 watts maximum, measures 7.69 by 23.44 by 3.75 inches (W x H x D) and requires a mounting depth of 3.16 inches.

B000CSY16E	X10 XPCR Coupler Repeater Amplifier	Electronics	Security & Surveillance	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dcZRr9Q2L._SY300_.jpg	"You can improve X10 performance and conveniently control X10 modules placed on different phases of your home's electrical system by installing the X10 PRO Wired-In Coupler Repeater Amplifier. The coupler/repeater serves as a signal-bridge across split-phase and 3-phase electrical systems, repeating X10 signals from one phase to another. Devices such as TVs, computer equipment, or anything with a complex power supply can absorb X10 signals. Even if you have a smaller home, but you use a great number of electronic devices, then installing the X10 coupler repeater is a great way to ensure maximum functionality of your X10 system. The X10 coupler repeater can work on three-phase (120/208 VAC) electrical systems, commonly found in commercial apartments and condominiums. In split-phase installations, often found in single family homes, one of the wires will be capped off and unused. The X10 coupler repeater has the same powerful capabilities as the standard X10 signal bridge, but it also boosts the X10 signal and blasts it out both legs of electricity at the same time. As long as the initial incoming signal is 100mV, the coupler repeater will kick up the outgoing signal to over 5 volts (depending on your home's impedance). Covers homes measuring over 3,000 sq. feet. NOTES: 1. The XPCR is not a filter. 2. Installation should be performed by qualified installers only. The main breaker must be turn-off during installation. The coupler must be installed in a suitable workbox or enclosure per local code."	969	X10	59.99

B0013IZ3FA	AUDIOENGINE - A5 BAMBOO (PR)	Electronics	Speaker Systems	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516xUqe%2BjqL._SY300_.jpg	"With all the talk of ""Going Green"" these days, at least one company is making a serious effort to minimize their impact on the environment. The Audioengine A5 is made from a renewable resource, sustainably harvested Bamboo. Bamboo is an excellent alternative to hardwoods and the dark bamboo is not a stain or veneer, but achieved through a specialized heating process. As the bamboo is pressure heated, the sugar compounds inside the bamboo are ""carbonized"" which in turn darkens the bamboo to a rich caramel color. Awesome sound, great looks, eco-friendly, and panda-safe! The A5 throws a huge soundstage with an incredibly stable image; has a rich, natural tonal balance; and impressive bass extension. Just connect to any source and get ready to be shocked by the performance of the fully-amplified Audioengine A5. The A5's custom tweeter cups focus their energy to the listening position, offering excellent inner detail and good sense of depth. The soft dome tweeter's sweetness is hugely appealing, making the A5s all-day listenable. The A5's custom-made Kevlar woofers have great speed and dynamic range, with a neutral tonal balance. The A5 produces bass that is firm and taut, if a bit rounder than might be found on more ""audiophile"" designs, but this is intentional, not a flaw, and makes most recordings sound a lot more exciting. Overall, considering the price and even taking the price out of the equation, the A5 offers a ton of musical satisfaction for a very reasonable price!"	82810	Audioengine	275.00

B0016K990K	Onkyo CS-325 CD Receiver System (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	Electronics	Speaker Systems	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419dujJC0yL._SX300_.jpg	"Built Around Proven Amplification Design, Solid Build Quality and Impressive MusicalityMini audio systems are all about improving your lifestyle. Beyond merely saving space, though, the right mini system adds functionality and style in an integrated package.The CS-325 CD receiver system takes things a step further, thanks to its exceptional ability to reproduce audio. Here, Onkyo has applied the same approach used in its acclaimed two-channel audio line-up.The end result is a system best described with one word: musical.The system&#x92;s multi-format-capable receiver sports a robust chassis designed to suppress vibrations. Meanwhile, the accompanying speakers feature a gloss finish on the front, as well as proprietary Onkyo speaker developments designed to deliver audio signals with punch, clarity and emotion.Amplification Design Built Around the Onkyo SoundAdd theOnkyo RI  iPod dockto add your iTunes music to your Onkyo CD system (sold separately)Due to their obvious size limitations, mini audio systems present various challenges to amplification design.The concept behind the CS-325 was to design a compact system with audio quality as the key consideration.Therefore, Onkyo&#x92;s engineers incorporated the same technology used in our renowned full-sized amplifiers and receivers:Wide Range Amplifier Technology.WRAT gives the CS-325 three distinct advantages: 1) A wider frequency response compared to similar mini audio systems; 2) Reduced amplifier distortion at high volume; and 3) Better control of current and electrical/mechanical kick-back from speakers.This enables the CS-325 to deliver audio of surprisingly high quality from such a compact component.Exclusive Onkyo Circuitry to Maintain Clean Audio SignalsLower-quality mini audio systems usually employ just one circuit at the output stage.With multiple transistors crammed onto a single circuit, excess heat is generated and the audio signal is compromised.The CR-325 CD receiver is different. It uses discrete amplifier technology similar to that found on Onkyo&#x92;s full-sized amplifiers and receivers. Keeping the transistors separate at the output stage enhances cooling, so the CR-325&#x92;s longevity is extended and interference to the audio signal is reduced. Conventional volume attenuation methods involve initially dropping a signal close to the noise floor at low volumes.This taints the signal with noise, which increases when the signal is amplified. By contrast, Optimum Gain Volume Circuitry adjusts the gain so that less than half the usual amount of attenuation is necessary.The signal never comes close to the noise floor, and the risk of noise is therefore reduced.The Option of iPod Playback Through RI Dock for the iPod (sold separately)Onkyo&#x92;s Remote Interactive (RI) function enables Onkyo component owners to integrate compatible components for operation via a single remote control. It also enables you to integrate the iPod with the CS-325 through Onkyo&#x92;s optional RI Dock. Simply connect the dock to the CS-325&#x92;s receiver, then place your iPod in the dock for control via the CS-325&#x92;s remote.The RI Dock offers a ""heftier and more detailed"" sound than can be experienced with an RCA stereo cable.Gloss-Finished Speakers with Proprietary Onkyo FeaturesThe accompanying D-325 two-way, bass-reflex speakers have a gloss finish on the front that will impress in any environment. Musically, they incorporate arange of Onkyo speaker developments designed to match the CR-325 CD receiver. For example, the woofer cones are made from Onkyo&#x92;s A-OMFMonocoque&#x97;a diaphragm fiber designed to support the range of piston motion. Also, to deliver high-frequency sounds with finesse, the speakers includea ring-drive tweeter that contributes to the restraint of low-frequency interference from inside the speaker. Finally, a duct&#x97;the Aero Acoustic Drive&#x97;is included to further mitigate interference between high and low frequencies.Simple Yet Comprehensive Control over All Your MP3sWith more and more music being bought online, the CS-325 is an ideal solution for bringing greater audio fidelity to MP3s. As MP3 files can be organized hierarchically in folders, you can use either of two modes--Navigation or All Folder--for selection and playback. In All Folder mode, all folders appear at the same level, making it easy to select one. If no specific file or MP3 is selected, all tracks will be played back in numerical order. On the other hand, Navigation mode lets you move through the folder hierarchy. The display button on the remote also enables you to see information about the MP3 being played, including the artist&#x92;s name and the song and album titles.Technical SpecificationsPower Output: 14 W + 14 W (8 ohms, 1 kHz, FTC); 19 W + 19 W (4 ohms, 1 kHz, FTC)Dynamic Power: 22 W + 22 W (3 ohms); 20 W + 20 W (4 ohms); 14 W + 14 W (8 ohms)Total Harmonic Distortion: 0.9% (Rated power), 0.4% (1 kHz, 1 W)Tone Control: &#xB1;6 dB, 80 Hz (Bass); &#xB1;8 dB, 10 kHz (Treble); +7 dB, 80 Hz (Super bass)Speaker Impedance: 4 ohms&#x96;16 ohmsAudio Dynamic Range: 95 dBPower Supply: AC 120 V, 60 HzDimensions: (W x H x D) 8 1/16"" x 4 9/16"" x 14 7/16""Weight: 8.8 lbs.Speaker Type: 2-way, bass reflexFrequency Response (Speakers): 50 Hz&#x96;100 kHzCrossover Frequency: 6 kHzMax.

B001K3JPRA	Olympus E30 12.3MP Digital SLR with Image Stabilization (Body Only)	Electronics	Digital SLR Cameras	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Lj1rLVdhL._SX300_.jpg	"Manufacturer's DescriptionThrough the centuries, legendary artists have expressed their individuality by relying on active imaginations and keen eyes to produce artistic masterpieces that alter reality to reveal a profound truth or feeling. The Olympus E-30 digital SLR (single lens reflex) camera is a powerful tool that takes the art of photography to new creative heights by offering the artistic freedom to capture what you see in your mind&#x2019;s eye, not just what you see through the camera lens.Like a brush stroking color across a blank white canvas, the E-30 delivers instant artistic gratification. Its ease of use and power to transform the everyday into something artistic will appeal to painters, graphic designers, illustrators and Web designers, those with an eye for fashion and artists from all walks of life, not just photographers. New Art Filters and Multiple Exposure change how we create images, unleashing a digital imaging experience unlike any other that produces striking works of art inside the camera without the need for costly computer image editing software.Beyond the new Art Filters and Multiple Exposure function, the E-30 delivers the same high-precision performance and imaging quality demanded by professional photographers who use the E-3, as well as the consumer-friendly features found on the E-520, and several new surprises all its own. As with all Olympus DSLRs, the new camera provides advanced Dust Reduction and in-body mechanical Image Stabilization so that every Four Thirds lens is stabilized. The new camera also offers TruePic III+ Image Processor and Full Time Autofocus Live View. These features are coupled with a new 12.3-megapixel high-speed Live MOS image sensor to capture breathtaking imagesOlympus E-30 Digital SLR HighlightsExpress Your Inner Artist with 6 Art FiltersSix new Art Filters allow users more ways to express their inner artist, creating a unique and new view of your subject. Couple these with the other creative functions, such as Multiple Exposure Live View, and take your creative expression to the next level. Select from Pop Art, Soft Focus, Pale & Light Color, Light Tone, Grainy Film, or Pin Hole Camera. Select an Art Filter and take pictures with Live View to see your results right on the LCD. This technology conveniently helps photographers transform a basic image that faithfully represents the scene into an image that carries emotional impact.Pop Art:Enhances colors, making them more saturated and vivid, creating high-impact pictures that express the joyful, lighthearted feeling of the Pop Art style of the 1960s.Soft Focus:Creates an ethereal, otherworldly atmosphere that renders subjects in a heavenly light without obscuring details.Pale & Light Color:Encloses the foreground of an image in flat gentle light and pastel colors reminiscent of a flashback scene in a movie.Light Tone:Renders shade and highlight areas softly to lend an elegant air to the subject.Grainy Film:Evokes the feeling of documentary footage shot in monochrome with grainy, high-contrast film.Pin Hole:Reduces the peripheral brightness of an image as though it were shot through a pin hole, connecting the viewer intimately with the subject at the center of the picture.Art Filters are easily activated via the mode dial on the left side of the camera body, and the effects are viewable right on the new camera&#x2019;s 100 percent accurate swivel 2.7-inch Live View HyperCrystal LCD when using the E-30 in Live View mode or when reviewing the captured image.Evolving Live View: Autofocus Live View with Face Detection and Shadow Adjustment TechnologyAutofocus Live View with Face Detection (up to 8 faces) and Shadow Adjustment Technology; to expand the creative shooting possibilities with your DSLR. This is the most advanced Live View to date with imager AF and advanced functions to free the user and give them power to express themselves in new ways. It&#x2019;s even easier to capture the shot with the 2.7-inch swivel LCD, providing 270 degrees of movement. Also, fine-tune your AF default position of the lens with AF Adjust Control. You can use the AF sensor to fine-adjust the focusing position to a range of +/-20 steps (-: closer, +: toward). Fine-adjust the AF default value and register the setting. You can also register the setting according to the lens.Swivel Live View LCD: Freedom to Move YouUnlike others with fixed LCDs, the new camera&#x2019;s 100 percent accurate 270 degree swivel 2.7-inch Live View HyperCrystal LCD can be rotated freely so photographers can compose at tough angles, including overhead and down low, without feeling like a contortionist. Because Live View enables an E-30 photographer to communicate face-to-face with subjects and still have everything in the frame with the camera body out of the way, an encouraging smile or wink of the eye can be used with a shy or nervous subject to get the desired results.During composition, settings like white balance and exposure can be selected, and their impact is seen instantly on the LCD, thanks to Live View. Real-time monitoring offers amazing versatility and creative control. The LCD displays 230,000 pixels in vivid color and includes HyperCrystal technology, which offers many times the contrast of conventional LCD monitors for easier viewing in both preview and playback. It also provides a wide viewing angle of 176 degrees, which ensures images can be composed from even the most obscure angles. The 2.7-inch LCD makes viewing icons and text on the camera&#x2019;s menu a squint-free process.Olympus In-body Image StabilizationIn-body Image Stabilization allows any lens to produce images free from the blur of camera shake and in low-light situations - from the 8mm Fisheye to the 300mm focal length. No need to spend money on expensive image stabilized lenses; it works with all FourThirds Lenses.Multi-Aspect Ratio ShootingSince photography is a form of expression that is essentially based on clipping a scene, framing is an important component of style. The E-30 provides nine aspect ratios including the standard 4:3, as well as 16:9 for impressive, cinematic-style images, and 6:6, which is available with medium format cameras, plus 3:2, 5:4, 7:6, 6:5, 7:5 and 3:4. By selecting the aspect ratio before shooting and easily reviewing images on the LCD throughout the shoot, the Multi-Aspect function adds a new means of expression to your photography.Digital Leveler: The Three-Axis Sensor Detects the Slightest Tilt of the Camera BodyThe E-30&#x2019;s Digital Leveler indicates the alignment of the camera related to the horizon, either on the rear LCD screen or in the viewfinder. The direction of the camera body identifies the tilt in both Roll and Pitch. The tilt of camera (roll and pitch) is displayed in the finder, on the control panel and on the LCD. The indication in the finder and on the control panel will change into the level gauge one second after pressing the shutter button (exposure indication is displayed before pressing shutter button). The starting point can be adjusted (zero degree point), and the tilt can be adjusted even when there is not a horizontal or vertical line on the screen.On the Fast-Track, with 11 Point Twin Cross Sensor and SWD LensesThe World's Fastest AF system is part of the E-30, matched only by the E-3. 11 Point Twin Cross AF and SWD Lenses combine to provide the World&#x2019;s Fastest AF. Matched to a quick 5 frame per second burst rate, and top shutter speed of 1/8000 seconds you can capture all your photos.12.3-megapixel Live MOS ImagerA newly developed high-specification Live MOS sensor with 12.3 million effective pixels is featured. Provides high resolution to faithfully reproduce subject details, with rich tones and natural, vibrant colors to satisfy the users&#x2019; aesthetic demands. Reading speed has been increased to support 5 fps shooting.Proven Dust Reduction SystemAn industry first and proven technology. The SSWF vibrates at a rate of more than 30,000 times per second at power-on. Change lenses in dusty conditions or anywhere without worrying about ruined photos.TruePic III+ Image ProcessingMaximizes the performance of the lenses and the 12.3-megapixel Live MOS sensor. Three image-processing technologies deliver even more faithful imaging, with a richer range of tonal expression and more natural color reproduction, especially for large-format prints.Program Camera Control (Landscape, Sport Action/Sport, Night Scene Portrait, Macro)The Program Landscape mode sets the camera to maximize the depth of field, while Sports or Action gives you faster shutter speeds to stop action. Macro is designed for close-up photography where greater depth is a must, and Night Scene Portrait-mode adjusts the camera shooting a portrait, allowing the background to come through for a pleasing image.5 Metering Modes (Matrix, Center Weight, Spot, Spot+Highlight, Spot+Shadow)Five ways to measure subject brightness: The advanced 49-area Matrix ESP meter, , Center weighted averaging metering, and 3 types of spot metering. 2% Spot Meter, Spot Meter with Highlight bias for shooting a white subject with detail, and Spot Meter with Shadow to capture black color with detail.Wireless FlashWith the RC Data Transfer no external commander is required thanks to the commander function incorporated into the built-in flash of the E-30. You can control remotely up to 3 groups (A/B/C) of flash arrays with different flash modes and other settings, giving you more lighting options. The E-30 makes using multiple remote flashes easy and lets you control them right from the camera.Dual Card SlotUDMA-Type I, Type II, MicroDrive and xD Media CardShutter MTFThe E-30 Shutter life is 100,000 exposures, making it one of the best in its class.1/8000 sec 30 sec + 1/250 X-SyncThe 1/8000 sec high-speed shutter enables instant shooting, while X = 1/250 sec is ideal for daylight synchro photography. Thanks to this high-speed shutter, shooting at maximum aperture is possible under a wide-range of conditions, enabling the superior imaging power of Zuiko Digital lenses to be enjoyed to the fullest. What&#x2019;s more, the high-speed, high-precision mechanical shutter has cleared a 150,000 continuous shot durability test.PC Flash SyncDesigned so you can use Studio flashes via in-body ISO standard PC sync.11 Scene Select Modes11 easy-to-use scene select modes are preset shooting modes that optimize the camera&#x2019;s settings to ensure great shots. cPixel MappingThe pixel-mapping feature allows the camera to check and adjust the image pickup device and image processing functions.Additional New Features of the E-30 Include:AF Focus Adjustment: use the AF sensor (when set to [Hybrid AF] or [AF Sensor]) to fine-adjust the focusing position to a range of &#xB1;20 stepsLens Data Set: fine-adjust the AF for each lens.

Of course, neither a Nikon 24.5-megapixel FX-format CMOS sensor nor 138 MB files are of value unless they deliver truly superior image quality. And in this regard, the new D3X exceeds expectations. Like its 12.1-megapixel D3 counterpart, the D3X features Nikon&rsquo;s exclusive EXPEED image processing technologies teamed with the proprietary Nikon Scene Recognition System to ensure the utmost in image fidelity, low noise, faster, more accurate autofocus and amazing file processing speed that makes continuous shooting at up to five frames per second possible. In addition, the D3X&rsquo;s ISO sensitivity range of 100 to 1600 (with Lo1, 50 and Hi 2 up to 6400) is mindful of the needs of photographers specializing in commercial, fashion and fine art photography.Nikon Professional D-SLR System SynergyNikon engineers understand that the needs of professional photographers vary with their assignments. Nikon also understands that a photographer's workflow can be seriously impacted by cameras with widely dissimilar handling, which is why the D3X takes its design cues from the enormously successful D3. Logical and familiar control layout integrates with rugged, reliable construction. And like the D3, the D3X features Nikon&rsquo;s 51-point AF system with 3D focus tracking. A bright 3-inch super-density 920,000-dot LCD monitor offers precise image review, along with razorsharp, 27x magnification for fast, critical confirmation of focus in one of two Live View modes, all of which contribute to the D3X&rsquo;s professional potency.More Nikon D3X HighlightsExtreme resolution 24.5-megapixel FX-format (35.9 x 24.0mm) CMOS sensorLarge 5.49&micro;m pixels capture astonishing detail and subtleties with outstanding dynamic range for demanding commercial applications.Nikon EXPEED image processing technologiesEXPEED extends and assures breathtakingly rich image fidelity and reduces noise, even at high ISOs.138 MB1 Processed NEF (RAW) 12 or 14 bit image filesSelectable bit depths of 12-bit (4,096 tones) or 14-bit (16,384 tones), both yielding incredible image quality through a 16-bit processing pipeline, for smoother tonal gradations.Low noise ISO sensitivity from 100 to 1600Added ISO settings of Lo-1 ISO 50, Hi-1 ISO 3200 and Hi-2 ISO 6400 extend versatility.Two Live View shooting modesTwo Live View modes add flexibility, and up to 27x magnification in the Tripod Mode, acute focusing accuracy is easily confirmed.Continuous shooting at up to 5 fps at full FX-format resolutionCommercial image quality teams with speed and handling to create new shooting possibilities--in the studio or on location.Fast, accurate 51-point AF systemAF system features 4 Dynamic AF modes, including 3D Focus Tracking, for autofocus precision and razor sharpness.1,005-Pixel 3D Color Matrix Metering II with Scene Recognition SystemTwo Nikon exclusive technologies provide intelligent auto exposure capabilities along with refined auto white balance detection and faster, more accurate A performance.3-inch super-density 920,000-dot VGA LCD monitorIndividual factory calibration assures the color accuracy of each D3X monitor for critical image review.Additional FeaturesRugged, durable and precise magnesium-alloy construction100 percent viewfinder coverageNikon Picture ControlDual CF card slots with overflow, backup and copy optionsVirtual Horizon Graphic IndicatorUp to 4,400 images per battery chargeWhat's in the BoxD3x body, rechargeable Li-ion battery EN-EL4a, Quick Charger MH-22, USB Cable UC-E4, Audio Video Cable EG-D2, Camera Strap AN-D3X, Body Cap BF-1A, Accessory Shoe Cover BS-2, Eyepiece DK-17, Battery Chamber Cover BL-4, USB Cable Clip, Software Suite CD-ROM"	2591	Nikon	1645.00

B001P06Q20	Olympus Stylus Tough-6000 10 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 3.6x Wide Angle Optical Dual Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Blue)	Electronics	Cameras	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41a4miP9v3L._SX300_.jpg	"There&rsquo;s really only one word to describe the new shockproof, waterproof, freezeproof, crushproof and shakeproof Stylus 6000 from Olympus: Tough. Built to withstand some of the harshest environments on earth, the Stylus Tough series builds on the impressive specifications of the renowned Stylus SW Series by adding Dual Image Stabilization. Now, when the Stylus Tough-6000 arrives at the windy mountain peak or dive into choppy waves, it stays steady and ready to capture blur-free images in virtually any condition.The 10-megapixel Stylus Tough-6000 is made for life&rsquo;s everyday adventures--especially those with kids. From the kitchen to a waterslide park and the bunny slopes, the Stylus Tough-6000 can take a drop from 5 feet, dive to 10 feet below the surface, and beat the freezing cold. It also features Tap Control to make it easy for skiers, divers and snowmen makers to control key settings without removing their gloves.Olympus Stylus 6000 HighlightsWinning the Battle of the Blur with Dual Image StabilizationFor the first time, Dual Image Stabilization will be offered on Olympus&rsquo; cameras in the tough category. In the cold climates where Stylus Tough-6000 thrives, you may shiver, but the camera performs sure and steady even in shaking hands. Dual Image Stabilization combines two technologies--mechanical Sensor-Shift Image Stabilization and Digital Image Stabilization--to provide one powerful anti-blur solution for capturing great images whether the photographer or the subject is moving. Olympus&rsquo; mechanical Sensor-Shift Image Stabilization keeps images sharp by adjusting the internal image sensor to compensate for camera movement, even in low-light conditions when shutter speeds are slower. Additionally, Digital Image Stabilization freezes the action with high ISO sensitivity and fast shutter speeds that prevent blurry images often caused by a moving subject.Nothing Can Shock This Tough CameraAfraid the mountain wind might sweep a camera out of your hands and dash it on the rocks below? Never fear, the Stylus Tough-6000, available in trendy yellow, white or blue tones, can withstand a 5-foot drop thanks to the Stylus Tough series&rsquo; shock-absorbing technology, which minimizes the impact on the lens and circuitry.Point-Dunk-and-Shoot CameraStylus Tough series cameras perform as well underwater as they do on land because their lightweight, stainless steel and aluminum exteriors are matched with interior rubber gaskets and O-rings to seal out the elements. The Stylus Tough-6000 can be submerged up to 10 feet underwater. The inclusion of four preset underwater scene modes makes these cameras perfect for taking photos while scuba diving, snorkeling or simply having worry-free fun in the pool. The camera also features a water-repellant lens coating to prevent water droplets from forming on the lens to get crystal-clear shots no matter how wet the shooting environment.Freezeproof for Arctic AdventuresWhether you&rsquo;re in the arctic tundra or building a snowman in your backyard, the Stylus Tough-6000 still performs when the temperature dips well below freezing (14 degrees Fahrenheit; -10 degrees Celsius). Stylus Tough series cameras continue to allow you to take great images in freezing situations where most traditional cameras would fail.Olympus Recommended ButtonThe new ""OR"" button makes it easy to activate Olympus&rsquo; unique features, including In-Camera Panorama, Shadow Adjustment and Perfect Shot Preview. Simply press the new OR button to easily access these commonly used features.New Beauty Mode: Supermodels Watch out!Taking beautiful portraits in the pool or on the slopes is easy with the new Beauty Mode. It enables you to soften shadows and smooth wrinkles or blemishes on your subject&rsquo;s face--all in the camera and as you capture the image! Additionally, subtle edits can be made post-capture using the Beauty Fix mode. Choose ""Clear Skin"" to smooth a person&rsquo;s complexion, ""Dramatic Eye"" to slightly emphasize the eyes, and ""Sparkle Eye"" to brighten and enhance the contrast of the iris and pupils. You can also apply all three edits at once. Have fun customizing your brilliant images without a PC and costly image editing software.Hit Them with Your Best Shot: Tap ControlThe Stylus Tough series cameras can be controlled with a simple tap on their top, back or sides, which is made possible thanks to their internal 3D accelerometer that detects the direction of the force on the camera&rsquo;s body. To turn on the flash or Shadow Adjustment Technology, all that is required is a couple of taps on the camera&rsquo;s sides and top. In adverse climates Tap Control ensures fast adjustment of settings even if you are fighting frostbite wearing large gloves that make pressing traditional buttons nearly impossible.Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Captures it AllThe Stylus Tough-6000 features a 3.6x wide-angle optical zoom (28-102mm equivalent in 35mm photography, f3.5-5.0) so that even more of the subject makes it into each shot--perfect for underwater photography. The lens does not protrude from its body so it is further protected from harsh conditions.Versatile MemoryAll Olympus digital point-and-shoot cameras accept xD-Picture Card media. Starting with products available in August 2008, they also accept microSD memory cards to capture images. The new Stylus Tough cameras offer the flexibility to use either xD-Picture Card or microSD memory cards, which is just one more advantage of Olympus point-and-shoot cameras.Advanced HyperCrystal III LCDThe next generation of Olympus&rsquo; LCD technology--HyperCrystal III--displays twice as bright as previous versions so that you can see the details more clearly, even in direct sunlight. The new technology is offered on Stylus Tough-6000 in a 2.7-inch LCD.Can&rsquo;t Hide with Face Detection!Portrait and group shots make family reunions live beyond the short event, and with Face Detection you&rsquo;ll capture even the shyest relatives. The Stylus Tough-6000 detects up to 16 faces within the frame and automatically focuses and optimizes exposure to capture sharp, brilliant portraits and group shots. Thanks to the unrivaled durability of the Stylus Tough series cameras, you&rsquo;ll capture amazing photos even if your next family reunion is at a National Park, a water park or a ski slope!Intelligent Auto Thinks for YouSkating at night? You won&rsquo;t be the last one on the ice thanks to Intelligent Auto Mode. It automatically identifies what you are shooting (i.e. Portrait, Night + Portrait, Landscape, Macro and Sports) and adjusts the camera&rsquo;s settings to capture the best quality results. First-time users can jump into this quick and hassle-free feature that does the thinking for them and produces incredible images.Broaden Your Horizons with In-Camera PanoramaThe places you can take Stylus Tough series cameras--the Grand Canyon or the volcanic sand beaches of Hawaii--are locations where you want to capture as much of the scene as you can. In-Camera Panorama mode makes it possible by capturing three images and stitching them together to create one amazing panoramic picture. Simply press the shutter button and slowly pan across a panoramic scene. The second and third images will be captured automatically and stitched together with the first image -- resulting in one seamless panorama-size picture. To create the ultimate panoramic picture, consumers can use the Olympus Master Software 2 to stitch up to 10 images together.Shadow Adjustment TechnologyShooting outdoors in bright daylight can be tricky because of the extreme contrast between dark shadowed areas and bright sunlit areas. While the human eye is capable of detecting the nuances between dark and light and all the details in between, image sensors traditionally have not been quite as sensitive. The Stylus Tough series addresses this challenge head-on with Shadow Adjustment Technology, which compensates for extreme contrast where the shadow areas are underexposed and lack visible detail. With this technology, users can preview and capture images with the same contrast as the naked eye.Perfect Shot PreviewThe Stylus Tough series features a Perfect Shot Preview mode that enables users to preview and select various photographic effects on a live, multi-window screen before snapping the shot. Perfect Shot Preview enables users to see precisely what the image will look like when adjustments are made, ensuring users are capturing the exact image they want. It is an ideal way for novice users to learn about the effects of different photography techniques, such as zoom, exposure compensation, white balance and metering.Perfect Fix In-Camera EditingThe Stylus Tough series offers Red-Eye Fix and Shadow Adjustment Edit, in-camera editing features such as resizing, and saturation adjustments, enabling users to edit photos right in the camera. With the Perfect Fix function, multiple editing features can be applied at once.LED IlluminatorAn LED Illuminator on the Stylus Tough series cameras works like a mini-flashlight on the front of the camera to enhance focus and exposure for macro shooting--great for underwater close-ups where light is scarce. The LED also works in conjunction with Bright Capture to help illuminate your subject when taking low-light portraits.TruePic III Image ProcessorOlympus&rsquo; enhanced TruePic III Image Processor produces crystal-clear photos using all the pixel information for each image to deliver superior picture quality with more accurate colors, true-to-life flesh tones and faster processing speeds. TruePic III captures sharp images at high ISO settings, minimizing image noise or grainy photos traditionally associated with shooting with high ISO.Olympus Master 2 SoftwareOlympus Master 2 Software provides the ultimate in digital imaging management. An intuitive user interface makes downloading to your computer quick and simple, and images are easily organized by folders or albums and searchable by date in Calendar view. A direct link makes uploading your images and videos to YouTube easier than ever. Additionally, with one-click editing tools, such as red-eye removal, images can be touched up before printing or emailing. Online support, templates, firmware upgrades and other user services are just a mouse-click away. Use the optional muvee Theater Pack to create professional quality slide shows and DVDs from your pictures using any of several built-in templates. Additionally, create scrapbooks, greeting cards and other fun prints using the optional ArcSoft Print Creations plug-in.What's in the BoxWrist strap, camera WIN/Mac USB cable, audio/video cable, LI-50B Li-Ion rechargeable battery, LI-50C charger for the STYUS Tough-6000, MASD-1 (microSD Adapter), manual, warranty card and Olympus Master 2 software (CD-ROM)."	7259	Olympus	253.00

B001QFZMB0	Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS1 12MP Digital Camera with 4.6x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD (Orange)	Electronics	Cameras	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31mXEQrxj7L._SX300_.jpg	"Panasonic's new Lumix DMC-TS1 is the world&rsquo;s first waterproof, shockproof and dustproof digital camera to also feature AVCHD Lite High Definition (HD) video recording capabilities.  The TS1&rsquo;s tough and rugged design makes it the ideal choice for active users needing the ultimate hybrid for capturing both still and motion images during outdoor activities.  The Lumix TS1, with a 12.1-megapixel resolution, features a 28mm wide-angle Leica DC Vario-Elmar lens, a 4.6x optical zoom and Panasonic&rsquo;s proprietary iA (Intelligent Auto) mode, making this an easy-to-use, yet powerful camera that packs advanced imaging features.The TS1 is waterproof to a depth of 10 feet, shockproof from falls up to 5 feet, and dustproof.  With its rubber padding, reinforced glass and carbon resins inside the camera, the TS1 features an airtight body protected against water immersion, dust and sand.Starting at the 28mm wide angle, and zooming up to a useful 128mm in telephoto, the TS1 gives users the flexibility for a variety of shooting environments--especially underwater, where movement is often restricted and the angle of view becomes important for composing shots.  The TS1 also features a 2.7-inch, 230,000-dot Intelligent LCD with a wide viewing angle, enhancing visibility during recording and playback by automatic brightness control according to the environment&rsquo;s lighting conditions.  Plus, the TS1&rsquo;s LCD panel is deliberately thickened for protection against pressure, allowing the display to operate with clear visibility even underwater.The TS1 records AVCHD Lite HD video, allowing almost double the recording time in HD quality compared with the conventional Motion JPEG format. The TS1 also features Dolby Digital Creator to record high quality audio to match the high-quality motion images.The TS1 features iA mode for both still images and in Movie Mode. For iA in Movie Mode, the TS1 features Optical Image Stabilization (O.I.S.), which helps prevent handshake when using high-powered zoom. Face Detection automatically detects a face in a frame and adjusts focus, exposure, contrast, and skin complexion on the face. Intelligent Exposure continually checks the ambient light level and adjusts the exposure setting as conditions change to prevent blown highlights and blocked shadows. And Intelligent Scene Selector automatically switches between Normal, Portrait, Macro, Scenery, and Low Light modes according to the situation to optimize visual quality.  A Wind Cut function is also available to block out most of the noise from background wind. Optical zoom can be used in motion image recording. Users can start video recording by simply pressing a dedicated button on the camera's back panel.The TS1&rsquo;s iA for still image adds Face Recognition--a feature that ""remembers"" faces from previous shots. When a registered face appears in the frame, the camera will prioritize focus and exposure to capture it beautifully.  With Face Recognition, when a familiar face is recorded several times, the camera will prompt you to register the face. Once registered, if the face appears into the frame again, the camera will display the name specified for that person and prioritize focus and exposure so that the registered face is bright and sharply focused.The imaging power of Lumix has further evolved with the Venus Engine HD, which boasts two CPUs to provide approx. 2.4x processing capability and support for Face Recognition, AVCHD Lite and HDMI output. It integrates the numerous advanced functions with high performance, and low-power consumption. Thanks to the Venus Engine HD, it&rsquo;s easy to view photos or movies recorded in AVCHD Lite. Simply insert the SD Memory Card from the camera in the Panasonic VIERA HDTV&rsquo;s Image Viewer SD Memory Card slot to start playback, or connect the camera via an optional HDMI mini cable to a VIERA Link-equipped Panasonic VIERA HDTV and use the TV's remote control to run slideshows.This multi-task image-processing engine also enables a fast response time. The TS1 starts up quickly in 1.3 seconds and shutter release time lag is approximately 0.005 seconds, making it easy to capture sudden, spur-of-the-moment photo opportunities.  The Flash Burst mode makes it possible to take consecutive shots with continuous emissions of the flash. The Venus Engine HD also supports a High Sensitivity mode that lets the TS1 record up to ISO 6400, sensitive enough to capture subjects in near-total darkness without using a flash.  Despite its outstanding performance, the high-performance engine is also more energy efficient, extending the battery life up to 340 shots (CIPA) per a single charge.Other features of the Lumix DMC-TS1 include:New Scene Modes for Still Images: Beach &amp; Surf mode gives users a single mode with optimized auto white balance for optical shooting on the beach and in shallow water.New Panorama Assist scene mode allows users to shoot a number of consistent photos, either vertically or horizontally, by aligning them according to a guide that overlaps the screen.  Then using those photos and the bundled PanoramaMaker software, users can create dramatic panoramic images.Increased Scene modes for both still and motion image shooting--optimized for a variety of situations. There are 26 scene modes for still image and 17 for motion image (Portrait, Soft Skin, Transform, Self portrait, Scenery, Low light, Food, Party, Candle light, Sunset, High sensitivity, Beach &amp; Surf, Snow, Aerial, Pin hole, Film grain and Underwater)LED Illumination is available in motion image recording.High-Speed Burst (Speed Priority) that fires off approximately 10 shots per second.Menus are clearer and easier to navigate with the Display Size option.Macro Zoom function lets users pull subjects even closer to capture dramatic close-up shots by using the 3x digital zoom in the wide-angle.Bundled Software: The latest version of PHOTOfunSTUDIO 3.0 HD Edition allows users to view, edit and archive captured content with greater ease and fun. Still and motion images can be transferred to the computer via a USB cable for viewing and archiving. Using PHOTOfunSTUDIO 3.0 HD Edition, users can edit and remove unwanted portions of video clips recorded in AVCHD Lite. Contents recorded in AVCHD Lite can be burned directly onto a DVD disc or converted to MPEG2 format.  The software also incorporates the Face Recognition function, which recognizes registered faces in photos stored on the computer, making organizing and archiving photos with a specific person much easier.  Additionally, motion pictures can be uploaded directly to YouTube."	10251	Panasonic	253.00

Though tiny, this system packs a big wallop inside their great looking high-gloss black cabinets.The RC-Micro proves beyond doubt that small can still be powerful. And it shatters any illusions about small, packaged home theater systems; you won&rsquo;t get better performance, or better looks, even if you buy individual pieces.&nbsp; This system delivers lifelike performance from your favorite games and movies, with precision balanced mids &amp; highs compliments of the Convergent Source Module, to the massive bottom end provided by a specially matched 240 watt 8&rdquo; compact subwoofer, which features a Ribbed Elliptical surround for great bass detail and extension.&nbsp; The hyperbolic aluminum dome tweeter on the satellites and center channel focuses sound for clearer dialogue and stirring music.&nbsp; Keyhole slots and threaded inserts allow wall and stand mounting, letting you choose how and where to place your speakers.&nbsp; The RC-Micro Center and satellite speakers are magnetically shielded to eliminate interference with CRTs or televisions.&nbsp; Gold plated push connectors ensure positive connection for top-flight performance.Convergent Source ModuleThe Convergent Source Module, or CSM, is the heart of an Energy speaker.&nbsp; It provides wide dispersion, low distortion and amazing midrange performance.&nbsp; The speaker&rsquo;s midrange and tweeter are designed to perfectly integrate with one another and are housed closely together to maximize driver integration, providing accuracy and excellence imaging.&nbsp;Ribbed Elliptical SurroundThe patented Ribbed Elliptical Surrounds that encircle our products&rsquo; woofers are unlike any other.&nbsp; By changing the shape of the speaker surround to an ellipse, rather than the traditional &ldquo;half roll,&rdquo; distortion is reduced dramatically.&nbsp; Benefits also include increased excursion and a larger piston area, allowing for greater efficiency and greater dynamics than conventional designs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Flat On-Axis Frequency Response with Wide BandwidthSpeakers should reproduce the entire audio range in a uniform manner. By ensuring that no one frequency dominates any other, Energy ensures that every note is the way it was intended to be--and the sound as natural as possible.Wide and Constant DispersionSound at all frequencies radiating from the speaker should be in an even pattern, in all directions throughout the room.Low Distortion and ResonanceNo speaker system is distortion- or resonance-free, but Energy has achieved a significantly lower distortion level, a clearly audible improvement.What Critics Are Saying About Energy RC Micro""What sets the RC-Micro apart from other offerings is both the clarity of the presentation, and the width of the soundstage.The RC-Micro is a very attractive set of home theater speakers, and have substance behind the flash. The same cannot always be said for other products in the space&hellip;it performed very well, and provides a great home theater experience.&rdquo;--Andrew Yang, Secrets of Home Theater and High Fidelity, October 29, 2009Technical SpecificationsFrequency Response:Sat: 150Hz-23kHz; Subwoofer: 36Hz-180Hz +/- 3dBCrossover Point:3.5 kHzSensitivity:88dBPower Handling:Sat and Center: 240 WattsRecommended Amplifier Power:20 - 100 Watts RMS (Continuous)Impedance:8-ohm compatibleSubwoofer Variable Low Pass Filter:40Hz-150HzTweeter:0.5-inch (12.7mm) hyperbolic aluminum domeMidrange:2.5-inch (63.5mm) high-excursion aluminum coneWoofer:8-inch (20 cm) Injection molded cone with Ribbed Elliptical surroundDimensions:Sat: 4.7 x 3.5 x 3.5in; Center: 3.5 x 5.9 x 3.5in; Subwoofer: 12.7 x 10.5 x 12.3inWeight:Sat: 1.6 lbs; Center:&nbsp; 1.9 lbs; Subwoofer: 16 lbsMaximum Performance TipsThe center channel speaker needs to be centrally located so that the dialogue appears to be coming from the center of the screen. It needs to be above or below the monitor, as closely to it as possible. If you&rsquo;re using a rear projection television, the most likely option is to place it above the screen. If you have a front projection system, you have choices--stand mounting, or placement on furniture, for example. It is important, though, to place the speaker so that its front edge is even with the edge of the shelf or stand supporting it. Unwanted diffraction occurs when the center channel is too far back into a cabinet or other surface with edges that could impede sound dispersion.For left or right front channels, the distance between the speakers should be 6-8 feet at minimum for the best stereo imaging. The optimum room shape is rectangular, with the speakers along one of the shorter walls, facing the opposite side. If possible, do not place speakers against a wall or at rear of a bookshelf; corner placement is usually the worst option. Try to keep the speakers--especially rear vented models--at least two feet from the surface behind it, unless you use a vent plug. For best results mounting on a rear wall, position the speakers so they flank the main listening area and point toward the front of the room. They should be raised to a height of approximately six feet and should ideally have a space of six feet between them.The three most common subwoofer locations include corners (which can result in boomy or exaggerated low frequency response), placement along a wall, away from the corner (producing moderate bass performance with increased fidelity over corner placement), or beside a front speaker (creating a better blend with the front speaker, but sacrificing overall volume). Experimentation with subwoofer placement is highly encouraged; slight adjustments can create big differences in sound reproduction. To test subwoofer placement, install it temporarily in your main listening position and walk around the listening room while playing a familiar piece of music until you find the best sounding position."	12120	Energy	275.00

B001TX9P6W	Olympus Evolt E620 12.3MP Live MOS Digital SLR Camera with Image Stabilization and 2.7 inch Swivel LCD w/ 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko Lens	Electronics	Digital SLR Cameras	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xewEiYbbL._SX300_.jpg	"As children, our imaginations run wild and finger-painted artistic creations are proudly displayed on our family refrigerators. But as we grow older, we learn to color inside the lines, and have less and less time for art. We often lose touch with how satisfying it is to create something uniquely our own. Olympus delivers the E-620 digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera to bring back that free-style experimenting and the magical feeling of being inspired by our own art.The easy-to-use Art Filters and Multiple Exposures (built right into the camera) are fun for photographers--whether you&rsquo;ve been shooting for years or picked up your first digital camera today. Enjoy capturing creative images on the go--without being tethered to a computer and editing software! Now it is possible to easily customize your images so they&rsquo;re worthy of posting on the gallery wall (or at least the family fridge).The E-620's freedom of expression is matched by its freedom of mobility. First, the camera travels with you to more places, thanks to its compact size and light 18.9-ounce body. Second, as the world&rsquo;s smallest DSLR with in-body Image Stabilization, the E-620 adjusts when your body moves to remove blur caused by camera shake (with any lens attached). Finally, add Live View shooting with a swivel 2.7-inch HyperCrystal LCD that frees you to cover subjects from a range of angles, and this 12.3-megapixel DSLR seamlessly combines motions with emotions--proof that Olympus lets you capture it all.Make Your Vision Come to Life with Art FiltersIf you&rsquo;re hoping to get more out of your camera than simply capturing and documenting a scene, and enjoy enhancing or customizing an image to make it your own, then you will value the camera&rsquo;s Art Filters. The filters, which are built into the camera, provide incredible individual artistic control over an image, and remove the need to spend time altering images on the computer with editing software.This camera was made for free-style shooting, experimenting and engaging with events and subjects. Enjoy the freedom of Autofocus Live View and dramatic effects to transform your day-to-day shots into compositions that you can be proud of with the following in-camera Art Filters:Pop Art:Enhances colors, making them more saturated and vivid, creating high-impact pictures that express the joyful, lighthearted feeling of the Pop Art style of the 1960s;Soft Focus:Creates an ethereal, otherworldly atmosphere that renders subjects in a heavenly light without obscuring details;Pale &amp; Light Color:Encloses the foreground of an image in flat gentle light and pastel colors reminiscent of a flashback scene in a movie;Light Tone:Renders shade and highlight areas softly to lend an elegant air to the subject;Grainy Film:Evokes the feeling of documentary footage shot in monochrome with grainy, high-contrast film; andPin Hole:Reduces the peripheral brightness of an image as though it were shot through a pin hole, connecting the viewer intimately with the subject at the center of the picture.Art Filters are easily activated with the mode dial on the left side of the camera body. The effects are viewable right on the new camera&rsquo;s 100 percent accurate swivel 2.7-inch Live View HyperCrystal III LCD when using the E-620 in Live View mode or when reviewing the captured image.Express Your Inner Artist&rsquo;s Multiple PersonalitiesWith the new camera&rsquo;s Multiple Exposure function you are free to tell a visual story your way, whether in a portrait, a landscape or a combination of both. For instance, capture an image of the spring leaves on a new tree and then overlay an image of your child&rsquo;s face into the leaves for a stunning image that expresses the newness of the season. The image capture options allow you to shoot one shot, then another, or to capture both shots separately and combine them in the camera later. Or superimpose your own portrait with a starry night sky to create a photo with the impact you desire. Let your imagination lead you to new creative discoveries.Ready, Steady, Go with In-Body Image StabilizationThe E-620 travels with you to more places, thanks to its compact size and light 18.9-ounce body. Capture sharp images on the go with the camera&rsquo;s in-body Image Stabilization, which virtually eliminates blur with any lens attached. Three IS modes handle any situation. The IS-1 mode is for general shooting and adjusts the sensor on both the horizontal and vertical planes to compensate for movement by the photographer so images stay sharp in low light even at slow shutter speeds. To capture the motion of moving subjects, the E-620 offers two specialized modes: IS-2 mode is ideal for capturing a runner or cyclist traveling by in the horizontal mode, preserving the sense of motion while panning; IS-3 mode achieves the same effect when the camera is held vertically. In either mode, the artistic effects of panning enhance the shot and render the subject in sharp detail with blurred background. Moreover, the E-620 is the world&rsquo;s smallest DSLR with built-in Image Stabilization, so you&rsquo;ll feel comfortable taking it on the road with you to capture the action.Superior Image QualityThe new camera&rsquo;s high-performance 12.3-megapixel Live MOS image sensor delivers excellent dynamic range, accurate color fidelity, and a state-of-the-art amplifier circuit to reduce noise and capture fine image details in both highlight and shadow areas.Its Live MOS image sensor is complemented by Olympus&rsquo; TruePic III+ Image Processor, which produces clear and colorful photos using all the pixel information for each image to provide the best digital images possible. The new image processor is noted for accurate natural color, true-to-life flesh tones, brilliant blue skies, and precise tonal expression; it also lowers image noise in photos shot at higher ISO settings, enabling great results in low-light situations.Swivel Live View LCD: Freedom to Move YouThe new camera&rsquo;s 100 percent accurate 270 degree swivel 2.7-inch Live View HyperCrystal III LCD can be rotated freely so photographers can compose at any angle, including overhead and down low, without getting bent out of shape. This enables an E-620 photographer to compose a subject in the Live View LCD and see the results of the various creative features--live as they&rsquo;re happening.When viewing the LCD in Live View, settings like white balance and exposure can also be selected, and their impact is seen instantly on the display. Real-time monitoring offers amazing versatility and creative control. The LCD displays 230,000 pixels in vivid color and includes HyperCrystal technology, which offers many times the contrast of conventional LCD monitors for easier viewing in both preview and playback. It also provides a wide viewing angle of 176 degrees, which ensures images can be composed from even the most obscure angles.The 2.7-inch LCD makes icons and text on the camera&rsquo;s menu easy to view. Beyond the camera&rsquo;s bright viewable LCD, the E-620 is equipped with illuminated buttons on its body that are easily viewable in low light to quickly find the settings you want.Two Fast Autofocus SystemsConsumers accustomed to composing and focusing using a point-and-shoot camera&rsquo;s LCD will appreciate that the E-620 offers the same easy, seamless experience (what you see on its LCD is what you get!). The E-620 delivers two fast autofocus options to quickly focus and capture the image in any situation:Fast Imager Autofocus in Live View:When it comes to measuring camera speed, autofocus is a key factor. If a camera&rsquo;s AF system does not meet photographers&rsquo; demands and lock focus accurately and quickly, it&rsquo;s possible to miss a shot. AF Live View on the E-620 allows you to compose, focus, and capture the shot quickly and easily without ever taking your eye off the large 2.7-inch full color LCD.Phase Detection AF:When using the optical viewfinder, the technology behind the new 7-point twin cross AF system provides world-class fast and accurate focusing based on the speed of the E-3. Super sensitive Twin and Twin Cross AF target points can measure focus both vertically and horizontally, so regardless of the subject, focusing is super-simple and fast. With a dedicated Phase Detection AF sensor in the camera body, shooting moving subjects, like a runner crossing the finish line, is lightning fast. In low-light situations, this is the AF option of choice to quickly lock focus, so that a loved one&rsquo;s face illuminated only by candlelight is in sharp focus.Multi-Aspect ShootingSince photography is a form of expression that is essentially based on clipping a scene, framing is an important component of style. The E-620 provides four aspect ratios that serve as masks to frame your image to the desired proportions, including: the standard 4:3 aspect ratio that is perfectly suited for an 8 x 10-inch enlargement; the 16:9 aspect ratio that will display your images beautifully on a widescreen television; and other popular aspect ratios such as 3:2 and 6:6. By enabling you to select the aspect ratio before shooting and easily viewing it on the LCD throughout the shoot, the Multi-Aspect function offers a new way to control your photography and express yourself.Always Find a Face in the CrowdThe new camera&rsquo;s Face Detection reduces the chance of blurred subjects in photography by distinguishing between people&rsquo;s faces and the background. It tracks up to eight faces within the image area, even if people are moving, and automatically focuses and optimizes exposure for sharp, brilliant portrait pictures (ideal for large family or party group photos).In Sunshine or the Shadows, Never Miss a DetailShooting scenes with both highlights and shadows can be tricky because of the extreme contrast between dark and bright areas. The E-620 addresses this challenge with Shadow Adjustment Technology that adjusts for extreme light variations and maintains visible detail in both the shadow and highlight areas of the scene. Now users can see and preview the gradation on the Live View LCD and capture images showing the shadow detail they saw. This feature is also accessible in the Edit menu after the shot has been taken.Preview a Multitude of PossibilitiesPerfect Shot Preview enables users to easily preview and select from a variety of thumbnail previews of the photographic effects of white balance and exposure compensation adjustments live on the LCD before taking the photograph. It is an ideal way for novice users to learn about the effects of different photography techniques, visually, without having to scroll through menu options. With 28 preset scene-select modes for every imaginable shooting scenario, automatic modes and full manual controls, the E-620 offers a world of possibilities to photographers.Wireless Flash CapabilityWireless flashes help you cast the best light on your subjects and capture great images. For this reason, the E-620 is compatible with the Olympus FL-36R and FL-50R wireless electronic flashes that are designed exclusively for digital photography. When these flashes are used in combination with the E-620, multiple-wireless flash photography is both easy and reliable. The E-620 can control up to three wireless flash groups independently, with multiple flash units in each group for dramatic flash effects.Dust Reduction System for Spot-Free ImagesLife moves too fast to spend time worrying about dust ruining the perfect image. Olympus&rsquo; proven Dust Reduction System produces spot-free photos with the exclusive Supersonic Wave Filter. The patented ultrasonic technology vibrates to remove dust and other particles from the front of the image sensor and captures it on a special adhesive membrane every time the camera is turned on. These spot-free photos liberate users from hours spent retouching photographs at the computer or sending their cameras back to the manufacturer to remove dust trapped inside. With Dust Reduction and the new creative features, Olympus continues to liberate users from the computer and editing software, and enables them to have fun capturing it all while on the go.Optional Accessories for Shooting on Land and in the WaterThe new HLD-5 Power Battery Holder (sold separately) can hold up to two Lithium Ion BLS-1 batteries to extend the performance life of the E-620 and its existing BLS-1 battery. It also enables effortless vertical shooting with its own separate shutter button and control dial. Olympus will also offer the PT-E06 optional underwater housing for the E-620. Capable of reaching depths of 130 feet underwater, the housing will ensure that divers will not miss an image during their journeys to the abyss.What's in the BoxE-620 Body14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko LensUSB CableVideo CableLi-Ion Battery Pack (BLS-1)Li-Ion Battery Charger (BCS-1)Shoulder StrapOLYMPUS Master 2 Software CD-ROMManuals and Registration card"	12000	Olympus	1645.00

Combine the EOS Rebel T1i with one of Canon&rsquo;s EF/EF-S lenses with Optical Image Stabilizer and watch your shooting possibilities expand even further.3.0-inch Clear View LCD (920,000 dots/VGA) monitorThe EOS Rebel T1i has a 3.0-inch high resolution LCD monitor that features 920,000 dots/VGA for far more detail than previous Rebel-series LCDs. It&rsquo;s the same screen found on professional models such as the EOS 5D Mark II. A number of features enhance usability: an anti-reflective and water-repellant coating provides a clearer and more smudge-resistant surface and screen brightness can be adjusted in 7 steps in accordance with ambient light.Auto Lighting Optimizer for superior highlight-shadow controlThe EOS Rebel T1i&rsquo;s Auto Lighting Optimizer is yet another image-quality tool that comes to the rescue in tricky lighting conditions. It can actually lighten dark areas of a scene while ensuring that bright areas maintain tonal detail. It&rsquo;s available in all shooting modes, including P, Tv, Av and Manual.Creative Auto goes a step beyond auto allowing controlEspecially for beginners looking to expand their photographic horizons, the EOS Rebel T1i offers Creative Auto mode. While basic settings are based on full automatic operation, shooting guides on the LCD screen enable you to make corrections based on simple to follow guidelines. In essence, with Creative Auto mode, you can learn about photography while taking stunning photographs.Compatible with over 60 Canon EF/EF-S lenses and most EOS System accessoriesEOS Rebel T1i is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF and EF-S lineup, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver unprecedented performance in all facets of the photographic process. Special optical technologies, such as Aspherical, ultra-low dispersion, or fluorite elements are featured in the universally acclaimed L-series lenses, and Canon&rsquo;s Optical Image Stabilizer technology is featured in select lenses, including the EF-S 18-55mm IS lens bundled with the EOS Rebel T1i, to minimize the effect of camera shake. With Canon lenses, you can truly maximize the quality and performance of the EOS camera.Flash PhotographyThe EOS Rebel T1i features Canon&rsquo;s acclaimed E-TTL II flash metering system. With any EX-series Speedlite, E-TTL II provides reliable flash output whether shooting fill-in flash pictures in sunlight or using flash in total darkness.

B0028N7442	Pentax K-7 14.6 MP Digital SLR with Shake Reduction and 720p HD Video (Body Only)	Electronics	Digital SLR Cameras	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51l3w6fZauL._SX300_.jpg	"The Pentax K-7 features a rugged, yet compact new body design, a new 14.6 megapixel CMOS sensor rebuilt from the ground up, and advanced features such as HD Movie Capture and new, unique-to-Pentax camera controls. Compatible with every Pentax lens ever made, the high-end K-7 features an abundance of long-anticipated new and improved features that are exclusive to the camera and combine to make it a tremendous photography tool.The most significant features of the Pentax K-7 that have never been offered before in any K series digital camera, and in some cases any camera, include:A compact, magnesium alloy body that is one of the smallest in the advanced photo enthusiast category to reduce bulk and allow users to travel light while maintaining durability and build quality (seven percent smaller than the K20D and up to 25 percent smaller than other cameras in the same class).A new 14.6 megapixel CMOS sensor rebuilt from the ground up to minimize noise, adds four channel output for fast image capture, and the ability to capture HD quality movies. It is the ideal combination of resolution and file size, allowing very large (poster size and larger) prints and cropping flexibility.A new 77-segment metering system quickly and accurately determines exposure for even the most complex and dynamic lighting situations.HD Movie capture features adjustable quality and resolution settings, aperture control, as well as mechanical Shake Reduction, and an external microphone terminal for recording stereo sound.* The K-7 will capture video at the default standard of 1280x720 resolution with a 16:9 aspect ratio (equivalent to 720p), 1536x1024 resolution with a 3:2 aspect ratio, or 640x416 resolution with a 3:2 aspect ratio (equivalent to VGA quality), all shot at 30 frames per second.An HDMI port with selectable output resolution (1080i, 720p, 480p, and auto) offers high resolution playback of images and video on modern high definition TV&rsquo;s.A Dedicated AF-assist lamp further improves autofocus response and accuracy in low light conditions.An Electronic Level function ensures that images have truly level horizons to minimize post-capture editing.An innovative in-camera Lens Correction function that electronically adjusts for Distortion and Lateral Chromatic Aberrations to maximize image quality with DA series lenses.A dedicated Mirror Lock-up function eliminates image blur due to mirror movement during long exposures.A High Dynamic Range (HDR) image capture mode captures three images then combines them in camera to widen the exposure gamut to bring out detail in all exposure areas of images.A composition adjustment feature in Live View allows minor shifts in the framing and composition of images using the Shake Reduction mechanism without having to physically move the camera. This feature is ideal for tripod use.A programmable embedded copyright function preserves artistic integrity and image ownership during capture via a keypad that may record ownership in metatag data.*Due to the compact size of the K-7 camera and the in-body Shake Reduction mechanism, a camera mounted microphone is a highly recommended accessory for optimal audio quality when capturing video.Pentax K7 Digital SLR HighlightsThe K7's magnesium alloy body is light, durable and weather-resistantA durable, functional body, smaller than any other in its classThe K-7 is built exceptionally solid and durable with a chassis made of a highly rigid stainless-steel alloy and a housing made of a durable but lightweight magnesium-steel alloy. Construction includes 77 seals for weather, dust and cold-resistance for reliable operation even under harsh conditions and at temperatures as low as 14&deg;F (-10&deg;C). The camera also features a newly designed shutter unit providing a top shutter speed of 1/8000 second and the outstanding durability to withstand 100,000 shutter releases. Despite all these features, the K-7 is one of the most compact and functional photo enthusiast level models in the market.High-quality image reproductionThe K-7 incorporates a newly developed CMOS image sensor measuring 23.4mm by 15.6mm and featuring a high-speed, four-channel image data readout. With approximately 14.6 effective megapixels, this image sensor more accurately produces fine-detailed, gradation-rich images. With the adverse effects of digital noise significantly reduced, the sensitivity may be increased from ISO 100 up to the highest level of ISO 6400 (via a custom function).High-performance, high-speed PRIME II imaging engineThe K-7 features the newly developed PRIME (Pentax Real Image Engine) II, an upgrade of the original PRIME, as its imaging engine. This new imaging engine offers faster data-processing speed for higher quality images with richer gradation and more accurate color rendition. The system also offers high-speed movie data transmission.A wealth of inputs--including HDMI--make it simple to share images and video captured on the K7High-quality movie recording at 1280 x 720 pixels; 30-frames-per-secondThe K-7 adds a new movie recording function, extending the benefits of SLR photography to the world of movie shooting: For instance, reduce the depth of field to make the subject stand out, or use different lenses to create distinctive visual effects. Beautiful movie clips can recorded at different sizes--640 x 416 pixels, 1536 x 1024 pixels, or 1280 x 720 pixels (16:9 high-definition TV proportions)--at a frame rate of 30 frames per second. The K-7 is also equipped with an HDMI terminal and an external microphone input terminal for high quality sound to match your videos.Large, easy-to-view 3.0 inch wide-view LCD monitor with 921,000 dot resolutionThe K-7 features a large 3.0 inch color LCD monitor with 921,000 dot resolution. The wide-view design allows the photographer to check the monitor image from approximately 170 degrees both vertically and horizontally, facilitating low and high-angle shooting using the Live View function.High-speed continuous shooting at approx. 5.2 images per secondThe high-speed continuous shooting mode captures as many as 40 images (in JPEG recording format) at a maximum speed of approximately 5.2 images per second, allowing photographers to follow the movement of an active subject or preserve a sequence of the subject&rsquo;s expressions.New 77-segment multi-pattern meteringNewly-developed for the K-7, a sophisticated 77-segment multi-pattern metering system greatly improves light-metering accuracy. By accurately analyzing various types of data (such as the image&rsquo;s composition and format between upright and horizontal, and the subject&rsquo;s distance and magnification) transmitted from the sensors in the camera body, this system greatly improves the accuracy of exposure control.Live View image confirmation with Face Recognition AF and high-speed continuous shooting modesThe K-7 features the Live View function, which allows the user to view the image on the LCD monitor during shooting. This function is available not only in the Contrast AF mode, which optimizes the focus based on the subject&rsquo;s contrast, but also in the Face Recognition AF mode, which automatically and accurately focuses on the subject&rsquo;s face. A newly developed diaphragm-control mechanism allows the Live View function be used during Continuous Shooting mode with the mirror at lock-up position.Optical viewfinder provides 100 percent field of viewThe K-7 glass prism finder offers 100 percent field of view and an approximately 0.92X magnification to facilitate focusing and framing operations. A new Natural-Bright-Matte III focusing screen improves focusing accuracy during manual-focus operation.3.0-inch LCD monitor with Live ViewNew 11-point wide-frame AF sensorThe K-7&rsquo;s new SAFOX VIII Plus wide-frame autofocus system features 11 sensor points (with nine cross-type sensors positioned in the middle). By adding the light source type to its data range, and driven by a greatly improved algorithm, Pentax improved the AF system assuring reliable, responsive autofocus operation superior in speed and accuracy to the previous system. The K-7 also incorporates an AF-assist spotbeam projector in its built-in flash unit to improve autofocusing accuracy in the dark.Next-generation Shake Reduction mechanism*The K-7 features the Pentax-developed SR (Shake Reduction) mechanism, which effectively compensates the adverse effect of camera shake by approximately 2.5 to 4 shutter stops, assuring sharp, blur-free images even under demanding shooting conditions. This innovative mechanism is compatible with all Pentax interchangeable lenses ever produced. This new-generation version allows complete shift freedom, including rotationally, of the image-sensor regardless of the camera&rsquo;s inclination. The mechanism also provides user-friendly new functions such as Automatic Level Adjustment and Minute Angle Adjustment (up/down, right/left and clockwise/counterclockwise) to help photographers compose images exactly to their specifications.* Lenses compatible with this mechanism are the Pentax K-, KA-, KAF-, KAF2- and KAF3-mount lenses; screw-mounted lenses (with an adapter); and 645- and 67-system lenses (with an adapter). Some functions may not be available with certain lenses.New DR II mechanism to minimize dust spotsThe K-7 is equipped with a newly developed Dust Removal (DR II) mechanism to more effectively remove dust and minimize spots on recorded images even after changing lenses in dust-prone outdoor settings. Using a piezo-ceramic vibration action, the system shifts or vibrates the low-pass filter located in front of the CMOS image sensor at supersonic speed to remove dust more efficiently. A unique dust-alert system also allows users to check for dust adhering to the low-pass filter prior to actual shooting.Custom Image function to easily create desired visual effectsThe K-7&rsquo;s Custom Image function lets the user control the image&rsquo;s finishing touch to capture their photographic intention, or reproduce the ambience of the scene. With the K-7, the user can select one of seven modes, including the new ""Muted"" mode designed to recreate an image with delicate, subdued colors. In addition to saturation, tone, contrast and sharpness, the function now makes it possible to adjust ""key"" and ""contrast highlight/shadow"" to the desired levels. The effects of these factors may be effortlessly confirmed on a preview image using the Digital Preview or Live View function before finalizing the settings.Versatile exposure system for exceptional reproduction of creative intentionsHyper Program functionThe K-7&rsquo;s Hyper Program function allows users to instantly switch to the Shutter- or Aperture-Priority AE mode from the Programmed AE mode, with a simple turn of the electronic dials on the grip.

B002ECF3HW	Pentax Optio W80 Waterproof 12.1MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Triple Shake Reduction Optical Zoom and 2.5 inch LCD (Gunmetal Gray)	Electronics	Cameras	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41tOhXPmVgL._SX300_.jpg	"More adventure-proof than ever, the Pentax W80 digital camera is waterproof, dustproof, coldproof, and now shockproof enough to withstand impact from a fall of more than three feet (one meter). Pentax first introduced dunkable digital cameras in 2003 to the delight of outdoor enthusiasts, travelers and families everywhere.Today, the Pentax Optio W80&rsquo;s waterproof design withstands depths of up to 16 feet (5 meters) to protect from rain and spills, as well as allowing full underwater photos and video for up to two hours. On dry land, the rugged, shockproof design protects against drops of up to 3.3 feet to protect the camera from hard use and occasional spills. Also featuring 12.1 megapixels, a 5x internal optical zoom (equivalent to 28-140mm), a slim one-inch body, and a wide-angle 28mm lens, the Optio W80 offers an expanded perspective that is ideal for landscape, group and more confined shots.With a Pentax-developed imaging engine and a high-performance Pentax zoom lens, the Optio W80 delivers brilliant, high-quality images with well-defined details. A Super Protect (SP) coating applied to the mineral crystal cover of the internal zoom lens helps repel water, grime and finger marks.Pentax Optio W80 HighlightsEnhanced rugged performanceWith the most watertight and airtight external joints ever, Pentax has improved the Optio W80&rsquo;s underwater performance to more than 16 feet for up to two hours of continuous operation. Along with this outstanding JIS Class 8 waterproof rating, the Optio W80 provides JIS Class 6 dustproof and coldproof performance for reliable operation at temperatures as low as 14 degrees F (-10 degrees C).New shockproof performanceWith shock-absorbent material positioned throughout the Optio W80&rsquo;s rigid and durable interior design, the Optio W80 will withstand impact from a fall from a height of more than three feet* without damage to the body for reliability even in harsh shooting conditions.*Measured under Pentax-original testing standards (from a height of one meter, on to a surface of 5cm-thick plywood), conforming to MILSTD 810F Method 516.5-Shock.Optical 5x zoom lens for excellent zoom coverage from wide angle to telephotoThe Optio W80 features an optical 5x zoom lens covering focal lengths from 28mm wide angle to 140mm telephoto. With this wide zoom range, the Optio W80 may be used for a variety of challenging subjects and scenes including landscapes, architecture, large group shots and tight snapshots from a distance. For a tighter zoom on subjects, an Intelligent Zoom function extends the zoom range to approximately 31.3x.High-quality HD-Widescreen movie recordingThe Optio W80 captures beautiful, flawless, high-definition movie clips at 16:9 TV proportions (1280 x 720 pixels)* at a frame rate of 30 frames per second. The camera also is equipped with advanced features designed to facilitate high quality movie recording:&middot;Movie SR (Shake Reduction) modeautomatically compensates camera shake during movie shooting&middot;Underwater Movie modeautomatically optimizes color for underwater movie shooting.*When the Optio W80&rsquo;s AV output terminal is used, movie clips are output as NTSC/PAL data. If the user wishes to play back movie clips at high-definition-TV proportions (1280 x 720 pixels), the data must be transferred to a personal computer for playback.Pixel Track SR modeWhen recording still images, the Optio W80&rsquo;s Pixel Track SR (Shake Reduction) mode effectively compensates for camera shake by processing the amount of image blur with a dedicated ASIC. Pixel Track SR tracks motion blur at the pixel level and calculates blur volume in real time. After exposure, the recovery filter centers the motion effect around each pixel to compartmentalize the blur. Then, an adjustment filter sharpens the pixels to help remove the blur effect. Pixel Track SR results in sharp images without adding high ISO noise.High-Sensitivity SR mode*The Optio W80 automatically raises the sensitivity setting to as high as ISO 6400 when it detects low-lighting conditions in still-image shooting so that a higher shutter speed may be used. This effectively minimizes adverse effects of camera shake and subject blur under poor lighting conditions.* When the High-Sensitivity SR mode is selected, the recorded size is fixed to 5M (2592 x 1944 pixels).Movie SR mode*During movie recording, the Optio W80 prevents blurry images by effectively minimizing annoying camera shake.* When the Movie SR mode is selected, the angle of view becomes narrower than normal shooting.Auto Picture mode for automatic selection of eight different shooting modesThe Optio W80 features the Pentax-original Auto Picture mode, which automatically selects the most appropriate shooting mode for a given subject or scene by detecting the subject&rsquo;s lighting and other conditions. This user-friendly feature chooses the best mode choice for the photographer (from Landscape, Portrait, Night Scene, Night Scene Portrait, Flower, Sport, Standard and Candlelight modes).Automatic Face Detection of up to 32 faces in a mere 0.03 secondsThe Optio W80 features the advanced Face Detection AF &amp; AE function for more accurate people shots. This function automatically detects up to 32 faces in the image field, and then optimizes focus and exposure settings in about 0.03 seconds. The Optio W80 is also equipped with the Smile Capture mode, which automatically releases the shutter the moment the camera detects the subject&rsquo;s smile and a Blink Detection function, which warns the photographer if a subject&rsquo;s eyes close at the time of shutter release.Large LCD monitor for effortless outdoor viewingThe Optio W80 features a large 2.5-inch high-brightness color LCD monitor with approximately 230,000 dots. This monitor is treated with a special AR (Anti-Reflection) coating to cut the glare of external light and minimize annoying reflections, making it easy to view recorded images even in bright sunlight.Additional featuresAn Auto Macro mode records dramatic close-up images of a subject from close as one centimeter.A Digital Wide function to compose extra-wide-angle images (equivalent to an image taken with an approx. 21mm lens in 35mm format) from two images.An AF-assisting spot beam projector (ON/OFF switchable) assists auto focusing operation in the dark.A new D-Range setting to prevent overexposed (washed-out) and underexposed (blacked-out) areas in an image.A decorative frame composite function to shoot or compose images with 90 photo frame selections stored in the camera.20 digital filters, including Toy Camera and Retro, add distinctive visual effects to recorded images.ACDSee for Pentax 3.0 image viewing, editing and filing software included (compatible with Windows Vista)."	11363	Pentax	253.00

B002OHDBZS	Pentax K-7 14.6 MP Digital SLR with Shake Reduction and 720p HD Video with DA 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AL Weather Resistant Lens	Electronics	Digital SLR Cameras	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vRKwFTgBL._SX300_.jpg	"The Pentax K-7 features a rugged, yet compact new body design, a new 14.6 megapixel CMOS sensor rebuilt from the ground up, and advanced features such as HD Movie Capture and new, unique-to-Pentax camera controls. Compatible with every Pentax lens ever made, the high-end K-7 features an abundance of long-anticipated new and improved features that are exclusive to the camera and combine to make it a tremendous photography tool.The most significant features of the Pentax K-7 that have never been offered before in any K series digital camera, and in some cases any camera, include:A compact, magnesium alloy body that is one of the smallest in the advanced photo enthusiast category to reduce bulk and allow users to travel light while maintaining durability and build quality (seven percent smaller than the K20D and up to 25 percent smaller than other cameras in the same class).A new 14.6 megapixel CMOS sensor rebuilt from the ground up to minimize noise, adds four channel output for fast image capture, and the ability to capture HD quality movies. It is the ideal combination of resolution and file size, allowing very large (poster size and larger) prints and cropping flexibility.A new 77-segment metering system quickly and accurately determines exposure for even the most complex and dynamic lighting situations.HD Movie capture features adjustable quality and resolution settings, aperture control, as well as mechanical Shake Reduction, and an external microphone terminal for recording stereo sound.* The K-7 will capture video at the default standard of 1280x720 resolution with a 16:9 aspect ratio (equivalent to 720p), 1536x1024 resolution with a 3:2 aspect ratio, or 640x416 resolution with a 3:2 aspect ratio (equivalent to VGA quality), all shot at 30 frames per second.An HDMI port with selectable output resolution (1080i, 720p, 480p, and auto) offers high resolution playback of images and video on modern high definition TV&rsquo;s.A Dedicated AF-assist lamp further improves autofocus response and accuracy in low light conditions.An Electronic Level function ensures that images have truly level horizons to minimize post-capture editing.An innovative in-camera Lens Correction function that electronically adjusts for Distortion and Lateral Chromatic Aberrations to maximize image quality with DA series lenses.A dedicated Mirror Lock-up function eliminates image blur due to mirror movement during long exposures.A High Dynamic Range (HDR) image capture mode captures three images then combines them in camera to widen the exposure gamut to bring out detail in all exposure areas of images.A composition adjustment feature in Live View allows minor shifts in the framing and composition of images using the Shake Reduction mechanism without having to physically move the camera. This feature is ideal for tripod use.A programmable embedded copyright function preserves artistic integrity and image ownership during capture via a keypad that may record ownership in metatag data.*Due to the compact size of the K-7 camera and the in-body Shake Reduction mechanism, a camera mounted microphone is a highly recommended accessory for optimal audio quality when capturing video.Pentax K7 Digital SLR HighlightsThe K7's magnesium alloy body is light, durable and weather-resistantA durable, functional body, smaller than any other in its classThe K-7 is built exceptionally solid and durable with a chassis made of a highly rigid stainless-steel alloy and a housing made of a durable but lightweight magnesium-steel alloy. Construction includes 77 seals for weather, dust and cold-resistance for reliable operation even under harsh conditions and at temperatures as low as 14&deg;F (-10&deg;C). The camera also features a newly designed shutter unit providing a top shutter speed of 1/8000 second and the outstanding durability to withstand 100,000 shutter releases. Despite all these features, the K-7 is one of the most compact and functional photo enthusiast level models in the market.High-quality image reproductionThe K-7 incorporates a newly developed CMOS image sensor measuring 23.4mm by 15.6mm and featuring a high-speed, four-channel image data readout. With approximately 14.6 effective megapixels, this image sensor more accurately produces fine-detailed, gradation-rich images. With the adverse effects of digital noise significantly reduced, the sensitivity may be increased from ISO 100 up to the highest level of ISO 6400 (via a custom function).High-performance, high-speed PRIME II imaging engineThe K-7 features the newly developed PRIME (Pentax Real Image Engine) II, an upgrade of the original PRIME, as its imaging engine. This new imaging engine offers faster data-processing speed for higher quality images with richer gradation and more accurate color rendition. The system also offers high-speed movie data transmission.A wealth of inputs--including HDMI--make it simple to share images and video captured on the K7High-quality movie recording at 1280 x 720 pixels; 30-frames-per-secondThe K-7 adds a new movie recording function, extending the benefits of SLR photography to the world of movie shooting: For instance, reduce the depth of field to make the subject stand out, or use different lenses to create distinctive visual effects. Beautiful movie clips can recorded at different sizes--640 x 416 pixels, 1536 x 1024 pixels, or 1280 x 720 pixels (16:9 high-definition TV proportions)--at a frame rate of 30 frames per second. The K-7 is also equipped with an HDMI terminal and an external microphone input terminal for high quality sound to match your videos.Large, easy-to-view 3.0 inch wide-view LCD monitor with 921,000 dot resolutionThe K-7 features a large 3.0 inch color LCD monitor with 921,000 dot resolution. The wide-view design allows the photographer to check the monitor image from approximately 170 degrees both vertically and horizontally, facilitating low and high-angle shooting using the Live View function.High-speed continuous shooting at approx. 5.2 images per secondThe high-speed continuous shooting mode captures as many as 40 images (in JPEG recording format) at a maximum speed of approximately 5.2 images per second, allowing photographers to follow the movement of an active subject or preserve a sequence of the subject&rsquo;s expressions.New 77-segment multi-pattern meteringNewly-developed for the K-7, a sophisticated 77-segment multi-pattern metering system greatly improves light-metering accuracy. By accurately analyzing various types of data (such as the image&rsquo;s composition and format between upright and horizontal, and the subject&rsquo;s distance and magnification) transmitted from the sensors in the camera body, this system greatly improves the accuracy of exposure control.Live View image confirmation with Face Recognition AF and high-speed continuous shooting modesThe K-7 features the Live View function, which allows the user to view the image on the LCD monitor during shooting. This function is available not only in the Contrast AF mode, which optimizes the focus based on the subject&rsquo;s contrast, but also in the Face Recognition AF mode, which automatically and accurately focuses on the subject&rsquo;s face. A newly developed diaphragm-control mechanism allows the Live View function be used during Continuous Shooting mode with the mirror at lock-up position.Optical viewfinder provides 100 percent field of viewThe K-7 glass prism finder offers 100 percent field of view and an approximately 0.92X magnification to facilitate focusing and framing operations. A new Natural-Bright-Matte III focusing screen improves focusing accuracy during manual-focus operation.3.0-inch LCD monitor with Live ViewNew 11-point wide-frame AF sensorThe K-7&rsquo;s new SAFOX VIII Plus wide-frame autofocus system features 11 sensor points (with nine cross-type sensors positioned in the middle). By adding the light source type to its data range, and driven by a greatly improved algorithm, Pentax improved the AF system assuring reliable, responsive autofocus operation superior in speed and accuracy to the previous system. The K-7 also incorporates an AF-assist spotbeam projector in its built-in flash unit to improve autofocusing accuracy in the dark.Next-generation Shake Reduction mechanism*The K-7 features the Pentax-developed SR (Shake Reduction) mechanism, which effectively compensates the adverse effect of camera shake by approximately 2.5 to 4 shutter stops, assuring sharp, blur-free images even under demanding shooting conditions. This innovative mechanism is compatible with all Pentax interchangeable lenses ever produced. This new-generation version allows complete shift freedom, including rotationally, of the image-sensor regardless of the camera&rsquo;s inclination. The mechanism also provides user-friendly new functions such as Automatic Level Adjustment and Minute Angle Adjustment (up/down, right/left and clockwise/counterclockwise) to help photographers compose images exactly to their specifications.* Lenses compatible with this mechanism are the Pentax K-, KA-, KAF-, KAF2- and KAF3-mount lenses; screw-mounted lenses (with an adapter); and 645- and 67-system lenses (with an adapter). Some functions may not be available with certain lenses.New DR II mechanism to minimize dust spotsThe K-7 is equipped with a newly developed Dust Removal (DR II) mechanism to more effectively remove dust and minimize spots on recorded images even after changing lenses in dust-prone outdoor settings. Using a piezo-ceramic vibration action, the system shifts or vibrates the low-pass filter located in front of the CMOS image sensor at supersonic speed to remove dust more efficiently. A unique dust-alert system also allows users to check for dust adhering to the low-pass filter prior to actual shooting.Custom Image function to easily create desired visual effectsThe K-7&rsquo;s Custom Image function lets the user control the image&rsquo;s finishing touch to capture their photographic intention, or reproduce the ambience of the scene. With the K-7, the user can select one of seven modes, including the new ""Muted"" mode designed to recreate an image with delicate, subdued colors. In addition to saturation, tone, contrast and sharpness, the function now makes it possible to adjust ""key"" and ""contrast highlight/shadow"" to the desired levels. The effects of these factors may be effortlessly confirmed on a preview image using the Digital Preview or Live View function before finalizing the settings.Versatile exposure system for exceptional reproduction of creative intentionsHyper Program functionThe K-7&rsquo;s Hyper Program function allows users to instantly switch to the Shutter- or Aperture-Priority AE mode from the Programmed AE mode, with a simple turn of the electronic dials on the grip. To return to the Programmed AE mode, simply press the green button positioned next to the shutter release button.Hyper Manual functionWhen shooting in Manual mode, a single push of the green button allows the user to instantly set the proper exposure for the subject.Sensitivity-Priority modeThe K-7 features a unique Sensitivity-Priority (Sv) mode, which is designed to automatically select the optimum combination of aperture and shutter speed for a user-selected sensitivity. The sensitivity can be shifted instantly in 1/2 or 1/3 steps by turning the electronic dial on the back panel.Shutter/Aperture-Priority modeTaking full advantage of the unique capability of digital cameras permitting automatic shift of sensitivity at any time, the Shutter/Aperture-Priority (TAv) mode automatically selects the most appropriate sensitivity for a user-selected shutter-speed/aperture combination. This allows the user to experiment with a greater range of photographic expressions with great ease.Powerful rechargeable batteryThe K-7 is powered by a large-capacity, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, which can capture approximately 980 images* when fully charged.*Under testing conditions prescribed by Pentax, when using a rechargeable D-LI90 lithium-ion battery with no flashAdditional features:HDR (high dynamic range) function to create one composite image with an extra-wide gradation range from three images with different exposuresDynamic-range expansion function to compensate for both white-washed (overexposed) and blacked-out (underexposed) areasDigital level function for easy checking of the image&rsquo;s levelsAutomatic compensation of distortion and lateral chromatic aberration (available only with DA- and DFA-series lenses)White balance control, featuring a new CTE mode to emphasize the color components of sunset scenes and a new incandescent-tinted fluorescent light modeMulti-exposure function, with a superimposition of already-recorded images on the LCD monitor for at-a-glance comparisonAttachment of copyright credits on recorded imagesRAW button for single-action switching of image file format16 digital filters to add a range of visual effects; a new function to record an overwritten history also availableColor-specific control buttons/dials for easy recognition and quick access, based on the universal color designPentax Digital Camera Utility 4 software package, including a RAW-data processing application (based on the popularSILKYPIX RAW-data processing engine developed by Ichikawa Soft Laboratory) and a browser application"	12161	Pentax	1645.00

This upgraded version is programmed to detect not only human faces, but also the faces of dogs and cats. When the user selects pre-registered dog or cat faces (up to 3 choices), the camera automatically detects them and optimizes focus and exposure. Users may program the camera to automatically release the shutter the moment the subject's face turns straight toward the camera, which is helpful for pet photography.High-quality, HD-proportioned movie recordingThe Optio W90 captures beautiful, flawless movie clips at 16:9 high-definition TV proportions (1280 x 720 pixels) at a frame rate of 30 frames per second.

B0040JHVC2	Canon EOS 60D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD and 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS UD Standard Zoom Lens	Electronics	Digital SLR Cameras	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5163UrUy7qL._SY300_.jpg	"With the new EOS 60D DSLR, Canon gives the photo enthusiast a powerful tool fostering creativity, with better image quality, more advanced features and automatic and in-camera technologies for ease-of-use. It features an improved APS-C sized 18.0-megapixel CMOS sensor for tremendous images, a new DIGIC 4 Image Processor for finer detail and excellent color reproduction, and improved ISO capabilities from 100-6400 (expandable to 12800) for uncompromised shooting even in the dimmest situations. The new Multi-control Dial enables users to conveniently operate menus and enter settings with a simple touch.The EOS 60D also features an EOS first: A Vari-angle 3.0-inch Clear View LCD (1,040,000 dots) monitor for easy low- or high-angle viewing. An improved viewfinder, a number of new in-camera creative options and filters, plus HDMI output for viewing images on an HDTV all make the EOS 60D invaluable for the evolving photographer. With continuously curved surfaces, user-friendliness and exuding solidity and refinement, the EOS 60D is true digital inspiration!EOS 60D Highlights18.0-megapixel CMOS sensor and DIGIC 4 Imaging ProcessorThe EOS 60D features a new, Canon-designed 18.0-megapixel APS-C size CMOS sensor that captures such a high level of resolution, it's easy to crop images for enlargement without concern of losing detail. A major factor in reducing noise, the CMOS sensor assures that images shot at highest sensitivity will be remarkably smooth.The improved DIGIC 4 Image Processor ensures that images are captured, processed and saved with remarkable speed. The EOS 60D DSLR's new 3:2 multiple aspect ratio, in-camera RAW image processing, creative filters, image resizing and provided S2 and S3 image-recording quality are all possible thanks to the DIGIC 4 Image Processor.  With dazzling results, the new DIGIC 4 Image Processor also works to capture and process data of images shot at 18.0 megapixels at 5.3 fps, as well as 14-bit signal processing for excellent image gradation, enhanced Face Detection Live mode, Full HD video recording, Auto Lighting Optimizer and Lens Peripheral Optimization.ISO 100-6400 (expandable to 12800) for shooting from bright to dim lightWith a broad range of ISO settings, expandable up to 6400 in the Auto Setting and 12800 with Custom function, the EOS 60D enables shooting from sunrise to sunset and helps ensure capture of the finest detail. With enhanced high-sensitivity optimization, subjects can be captured clearly and easily at high shutter speeds without flash, with minimized blur and noise. In bright scenes, especially long exposures in daylight, optimal exposure can be achieved with a fully open wide-diameter lens, no dark filter needed.Improved EOS HD Video mode with manual exposure controlDesigned for the evolving, tech-savvy user, the EOS 60D features HD Video capture technologies--manual exposure control for more creative control, for example--borrowed directly from professional Canon DSLRs to capture stellar video with all the benefits of shooting with a DSLR. By shooting video with the EOS 60D, photographers as well as filmmakers can take advantage of the creative features native to DSLR cameras. Along with its manual controls, the EOS 60D allows for full use of Canon EF and EF-S lenses, including Macro and Fisheye, providing a plethora of shooting options once reserved only for still photography. The resulting HD video is a standout in its beautiful depth-of-field characteristics and remarkable capture capability under poor lighting conditions. Additionally, a Movie Crop function is included: An SD-quality video (640 x 480) can be cropped to the equivalent of about 7x magnification of regular shooting.The audio input level can be set to Auto or Manual, up to 64 levels, and a wind filter minimizes unwanted background noise. By pressing the Quick Control button, a simple graphic user interface for adjusting image quality, white balance, image creation and other settings appears on the LCD. The EOS 60D even lets users edit video in-camera: On-site or off, unnecessary scenes can be deleted and the start/end points of video footage can be designated via in-camera editing functions without the need of a separate computer.Video can be captured at a number of resolutions and frame rates for numerous applications. It can capture 1920 x 1080 Full HD video at frame rates of 30 (29.97 fps), 24 (23.976 fps) and 25.0 frames per second, for up to 4GB per clip. Video footage is saved as MOV files and can be viewed in Full HD through the EOS 60D DSLR's HDMI output. Other recording sizes include HD at 1280 x 720 (50/60 fps) or SD/VGA at 640 x 480 (50/60 fps)--24/30 fps delivers cinema-like motion, while 60fps is perfect for footage being uploaded to video-sharing websites.  The EOS 60D also has a built-in microphone for simple mono recording and stereo sound can be recorded through a self-powered external microphone.Vari-angle 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitorA first for any EOS, the EOS 60D features a bright, high resolution, flip-out Vari-angle 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor for shooting at a variety of angles. By easily switching between low and high angles, the EOS 60D freely enables angle adjustments even if the camera is mounted on a tripod or has a battery grip attached.With 1,040,000 (dots/VGA) pixels for spectacular detail, the advanced, smudge-resistant monitor includes high transparency materials plus anti-reflective and water-repellant coatings to provide clear and bright viewing. Superb for reviewing, editing and deleting photos or composing new images in Live View function, the Vari-angle Clear View LCD monitor is also the perfect means for accessing camera settings like ISO, metering modes, AF Point selection, the horizontal Electronic Level and flash options.5.3fps continuous shooting up to approx. 58 Large/JPEGs and 16 RAWThe EOS 60D operates with such effortless speed that operation is nothing short of intuitive. With a 0.1 second start-up time, speedy autofocus and minimal shutter lag, the EOS 60D is made to capture even rapidly-occurring scenes with stunning precision. Able to shoot up to 5.3 frames per second (fps), capturing a maximum burst of approximately 58 Large/JPEGs and 16 RAW, the EOS 60D DSLR lets you catch even the briefest of moments, whether it's a faced-paced soccer game or the flicker of a candle flame.96% viewfinder coverage allowing you to see more of your image in the viewfinderThe EOS 60D features a phenomenally redesigned viewfinder that not only offers an improved 96% coverage, 0.95x magnification, a 27.0&deg; angle of view and user-controlled dioptric adjustment, it also features a newly designed transparent LCD display that enables a number of viewfinder displays. A six-level battery check indicator has been added on the left, and the exposure level indicator scale has been expanded to up to three stops, with arrows indicating greater exposure levels.The 60D's Electronic Level.The EOS 60D also features an advanced horizontal Electronic Level, that, when activated, is superimposed on the LCD monitor to aid in achieving evenly leveled shots by indicating the horizontal tilt up to approximately 9&deg; in 1&deg; increments.Enhanced iFCL 63-zone, Dual-layer metering system; and 9-point AF systemThe EOS 60D features a sophisticated, 63-zone Dual-layer sensor designed to complement the 9-point AF system. By taking into account the color and luminosity surrounding chosen AF points, this system delivers an advanced level of accuracy for better results even in difficult lighting situations. Since the metering sensor has a color measurement function, exposure errors and focus errors caused by different light sources are minimized; the EOS 60D gives stable exposure from shot to shot in situations where light changes, such as in a theater or concert hall.  This makes the EOS 60D ideal for scenes with extreme difference in brightness such as brightly lit scenes or backlit scenes; the camera balances exposure of the main subject at the background, and exposures are not overly influenced by bright areas in the shot.Since the EOS 60D provides high-speed X-sync (""X-sync"" means the fastest shutter speed that can synchronize with a flash burst at the moment the shutter is fully released) up to 1/250 sec., the range of photographic expression is dramatically increased, allowing the EOS 60D to be used with confidence in bright scenes or dim.Metering zones.Convert RAW images into JPEGs in-camera and set the images to a 3:2 aspect ratioThe EOS 60D marks a highpoint in convenience for the photographer by being able to shoot an image as a RAW file and then process it entirely in-camera to produce a separate JPEG file without the need of an outside computer. The EOS 60D gives you 10 process variables--brightness adjustment, white balance, Picture Style, Auto Lighting Optimizer, noise reduction, JPEG image-recording quality, color space, lens peripheral illumination correction, distortion correction and chromatic aberrations correction--to create the image you envision, set to the 3:2 aspect ratio used in 35mm film.Additionally, once you capture an image with the EOS 60D, you can digitally manipulate it in-camera with a number of creative filters for artistic and dramatic effect. Options include Soft Focus Effect to convey dreamy tableaus; Grainy Black-and-White Effect for a gritty, hard-bitten look; Toy Camera Effect--the deliberate vignetting and color shift technique popular in art photography--and Miniature Effect, which blurs the top and bottom edges of the image to emphasize perspective and conveys a miniaturized look of the scene.Compatibility with SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cardsThe EOS 60D DSLR uses popular SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards. Compact, inexpensive and available in increasingly large capacities, SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards are a perfect complement to the EOS 60D DSLR's compact and lightweight body design.Compatible with the full line of Canon EF and EF-S lensesThe EOS 60D is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF and EF-S lineup, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver unprecedented performance in all facets of the photographic process. Special optical technologies, such as aspherical, ultra-low dispersion, or fluorite elements are featured in the universally acclaimed L-series lenses. And Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer technology is featured in select lenses to minimize the effect of camera shake. Additionally, photographers can use for video the same lenses they do for still photography; Canon wide-angle, macro, super-telephoto, tilt-shift and fisheye lenses provide a wealth of focal lengths, depth-of-field and other creative shooting options once reserved for stills. Through Canon lenses, photographers can truly maximize the quality and liberating performance of the EOS 60D.Flash PhotographyWith a flash sync speed of 1/250 of a second, the EOS 60D also features the acclaimed E-TTL II flash metering system. With any of the flashes in the EX Speedlite line (sold separately), E-TTL II provides reliable flash output whether shooting fill-in flash pictures in sunlight, or using flash in total darkness. With E-TTL II, the exact same 35-zone metering sensor used for measuring ambient light is also used for flash metering--giving even finer metering command of the image area. If you prefer a broader area for flash metering, there's a menu setting to change to ""Average"" flash metering--where the entire 35-zone area is measured evenly for flash exposure. Additionally, the EOS 60D has a Speedlite transmitter built-in for convenient, full-featured wireless control of EX-series Speedlite flashes set as slave units.The Canon Speedlite 430EX II is the ideal step-up accessory for powerful flash shooting with the EOS 60D. It has excellent flash power (maximum guide number of 141 ft./43m at ISO 100), and is the perfect way to get great flash pictures when you can't get right up to the subject. The 430EX II is also great for bounce flash, with its tilting and swiveling flash head.  It automatically zooms the flash head to cover lenses ranging from 16mm up to 105mm or longer with the EOS 60D. Of course, it works with the camera to provide full E-TTL II automatic flash exposure. And the 430EX II has a powerful AF-assist beam, which allows the camera to autofocus even in total darkness on subjects as far as 32 ft. from the camera.Included SoftwareCanon EOS Digital Solution Disk (Version 23.0)The EOS 60D comes bundled with an updated Canon EOS Digital Solution Disk, which features powerful software programs designed to extend the EOS experience to the computer.

B0042X9LC4	Nikon D7000 DSLR (Body Only) (OLD MODEL)	Electronics	Digital SLR Cameras	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51x2%2BvRf-xL._SX300_.jpg	"D7000Meet the new Nikon D7000, a camera ready to go wherever your photography or cinematography takes you. Experience stunning images with sharp resolution and smooth tonal gradation, thanks to the 16-megapixel DX-format CMOS image sensor and a powerful EXPEED 2 image processing engine. Take advantage of its wide ISO range of 100 to 6400 (expandable to 25,600) and its incredibly low levels of noise. Expect your images tack-sharp and accurately exposed, thanks to the camera&rsquo;s 39-point AF and Scene Recognition System using a 2,016-pixel RGB matrix metering sensor. And with an approx.&nbsp; 0.052-second release time lag and approx. 6 frames-per-second shooting, you won&rsquo;t miss a moment.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll see exactly what you&rsquo;re capturing with the approx. 100% frame coverage viewfinder, and for those who want to shoot both stills and movies, the D7000&rsquo;s D-Movie capabilities now include Full HD 1080p capture with full-time autofocus and manual exposure. All of this advanced imaging technology is kept safe beneath the magnesium alloy covering the top and rear chassis of a compact body, whose sealing has been severely tested against moisture and dust. The D7000 is ready to shoot indoors and out, and at 150,000 cycles tested, the camera&rsquo;s durable shutter unit helps you keep shooting. Combine all this with the unmatched NIKKOR lens lineup and Creative Lighting System and you have everything you need to explore your imagination to its fullest. Where can creative freedom like this take you? Find out, with the D7000.D7000 HighlightsStunning image details: 16.2 effective megapixelsWhether you want to make large prints or crop tightly in an image, the D7000 delivers the resolution you need. At its heart is a DX-format CMOS image sensor with 16.2 effective megapixels, optimally engineered to gather more quality light through sharp NIKKOR lenses.&nbsp; Coupled with 14-bit A/D conversion (12-bit selectable), the D7000 produces stunning images that are richer in tone and detail than previously possible in DX format. The A/D conversion happens within the sensor, thereby maintaining exceptional image integrity without sacrificing shooting speed or energy efficiency. Combine these with the agile DX format and its signature 1.5x focal length telephoto potential and you can begin to see where this kind of shooting power can take you.Improved image quality and speed: EXPEED 2 image processing engineSometimes you want to capture the subtle tones of a sunset. Other times you want to freeze the action. The D7000 delivers both, thanks to the newest generation of image processing engine, EXPEED 2, which performs multiple tasks with more speed and power. Expect smoother tonal gradations, even in difficult shadows and highlights, for a greater sense of depth in your images. Shoot continuously at 6 frames per second so you can capture the action you&rsquo;ve been missing. Focusing performance such as face recognition in Live View mode is also further improved, letting you concentrate on your composition.Standard ISO 100 to 6400, expandable to ISO 25600 equivalentWith improved pixel quality of the image sensor comes a wider ISO range from the DX-format &mdash; ISO 100 to 6400 has now become standard with the D7000, enabling you to handle a wider range of lighting situations: from the bright and sunny outdoors to low-lit evenings and interiors. Nikon&rsquo;s renowned noise reduction technology has been upgraded even further. Throughout the range, the D7000 delivers sharp images with minimized color noise. And thanks to the higher processing speed, even when High ISO noise reduction is activated, you can keep shooting continuously without stress. Quality high-ISO performance can also enhance a lot for movie shooting, allowing you to capture the mood of a scene using only available light.Capture Full HD 1080p D-Movie with full-time autofocus and manual exposureThe D7000 welcomes in a new era of movie capture: Full HD 1080p and movie editing functions for exceptional cinematic reproduction and quality. In addition to smooth-moving images, the camera can compensate for distortion and other image-degrading problems. Besides auto exposure mode, the D7000 offers manual exposure mode, which locks in the exposure value when shooting scenes with varying contrast levels, such as when panning from a bright window to a dark interior. Aside from a built-in monaural microphone, the D7000 incorporates an external microphone jack for high-quality stereo sound recording options.Improved quality in highlight and shadow: Active D-LightingNikon&rsquo;s exclusive Active D-Lighting offers the ability to preserve details in the highlights and shadowy areas of images shot in high-contrast scenes.Whether you&rsquo;re dealing with bright skies and a dark foreground or deep shadows where you can&rsquo;t use a flash, the EXPEED 2 image processing engine renders those scenes with smoother tones &mdash; even at its highest settings. Simply select Auto in Active D-Lighting mode and the camera can adjust to the scene&rsquo;s contrast levels or bracket them into three frames of varying strength levels. Even when Active D-Lighting is activated, you can still maintain the continuous shooting rate.&nbsp;Now even more precise: The Scene Recognition SystemThe D7000 incorporates a built-in exposure-metering sensor with a far larger pixel count than any other D-SLR camera before it. The 2,016-pixel RGB sensor reads the scene&rsquo;s brightness and colors more accurately, and then applies this reading to optimize not only exposure, but also autofocus, white balance and i-TTL flash calculations &mdash; all in mere milliseconds prior to the actual exposure. With more pixels, the D7000 can recognize even smaller subjects &mdash; both moving and stationary. The newly improved Scene Recognition System delivers better photographs in every way.Wide-area coverage, powerful 39-point AFThe D7000&rsquo;s strategically positioned 39 AF points cover a significantly wide area of the frame, giving you flexible compositional possibilities. The nine AF points in the center utilize powerful cross-type sensors &mdash; especially useful when you need tack-sharp focus such as with portraits and macro work. And unlike other manufacturers&rsquo; systems, the D7000&rsquo;s nine cross-type sensors work with all AF NIKKOR lenses f/5.6 or faster. The D7000 offers a variety of AF area modes, including dynamic-area AF using 9, 21, 39 points. Switch between the three, depending on the predictability of your subjects&rsquo; movement, and the selected AF point and surrounding points will track your intended subject automatically.There is also 3D tracking, which continuously follows moving subjects within the 39 AF points, indicating the activated AF point in the viewfinder. Utilizing Nikon&rsquo;s Scene Recognition System, Auto-area AF properly judges the main subject within 39 AF points and focuses on it. Therefore, no matter what the situation or composition calls for, the D7000&rsquo;s autofocus system will be ready to meet your focus needs.39-point AF & 2,016-pixel RGB sensorStay focused on what matters most.Sophisticated AE with highlight analysisAfter the incredibly accurate 2016-pixel RGB sensor reads a scene&rsquo;s lighting information such as brightness and colors, the D7000 cross-references what it sees with imaging data from 30,000 real-world shooting situations. This way, the renowned 3D Color Matrix Metering II delivers exposure results that are faithful to how you see light and shadow interplay, even in difficult lighting situations. This intelligent metering technique also delivers exceptionally accurate i-TTL flash exposures, and it all happens within milliseconds for both speed and precision.Informed auto white balance (AWB)Based on its massive collection of shooting data compiled from various light sources, the D7000&rsquo;s intelligent AWB algorithm renders white as truly white &mdash; even when shot under a wide range of light sources, including the difficult mercury vapor lighting. The D7000 also carries another AWB mode that maintains incandescent warmth in your images.Contrast AF for live view and D-MovieLive View and D-Movie users can rejoice, because with the D7000, face-priority AF is now faster and more powerful than ever. Up to 35 people can be. For moving subjects such as pets, subject-tracking AF keeps them in focus. Normal-area AF is recommended for pinpoint focus and wide-area AF for handheld shooting. All are effective both for Live View shooting and movie recording.6 Frames Per Second Shooting up to 100 ImagesSay farewell to missed opportunities. The D7000 incorporates a new driving mechanism to conduct its remarkably fast and precise mirror movements, giving you an approx. 0.052 second release time lag and an approx. 0.13 second start-up time. What&rsquo;s more, you can continuously shoot at approx. 6 frames per second at both 14-bit and 12-bit A/D conversion for RAW shooting.Rugged and protected: compact magnesium alloy body and sealing against dust and moistureWith a top and rear cover of durable magnesium alloy, the D7000 is ready for the outdoors. Nikon engineers paid meticulous attention to where exterior parts join by employing durable sealing against moisture and dust. The compact body has also undergone severe environmental tests to prove its rugged reliability.Approx. 100% frame coverage viewfinderWith approximately 100% frame coverage in the viewfinder, what you see is what you exactly capture. The specially coated glass pentagonal prism and precision-crafted finder screen offer not only a bright viewfinder image, but also enable you to easily confirm when a subject is in focus.Precision and durability: 150,000 cycles tested shutter unitThe D7000 has a shutter speed range of 1/8000 to 30 seconds, with a top flash synchronization speed of 1/250 second. And just like with professional models, the shutter unit is tested for 150,000 cycles in severe conditions, proving precision and durability.Intuitive operation: strategically located dials, buttons and switchesEach and every control on the D7000 has been strategically placed for streamlined operation. The exposure mode dial and release mode dial are stacked on the same axis for easier access. Two new user settings can be assigned to the exposure mode dial. The release mode dial now offers a quiet shutter release mode for near-silent operation and one-touch Live View and movie recording are now possible, thanks to a newly designed switch and button structure.921k-dots, 170-degree viewing angle, 3-inch LCD monitorThe D7000 features an expansive 3-inch VGA LCD monitor with reinforced glass. Its approx. 921k-dot resolution assures clear, detailed display of images, which proves invaluable when confirming focus or assessing image sharpness. The wide 170&deg; viewing angle and bright display make it easy to review images or confirm menu settings when shooting outdoors.Electronic Virtual HorizonEspecially useful for landscape shooting, the virtual horizon indicated in the LCD lets you know when the camera is level. The virtual horizon can also be displayed during Live View shooting.Twin SD card slots (cards not included)Two memory card slots offer a number of advantages: sequential recording; recording the same images simultaneously on two cards; recording RAW and JPEG separately onto two different cards; and duplicating images from one card to another. It&rsquo;s also possible to designate a specific card with more memory for use at the time of movie recording.Intelligent power managementAfter carefully scrutinizing every aspect of the camera&rsquo;s circuitry, Nikon engineers have designed the D7000 for maximum performance with minimized power usage. With the newly designed Rechargeable Li-ion Battery EN-EL15, 1,050 frames* can be taken on a single charge.*With EN-EL15, based on CIPA standards.Nikon Creative Lighting SystemThe D7000 has a built-in pop-up flash that covers a 16mm lens perspective without vignetting. The flash is fully compatible with the Nikon Creative Lighting System (CLS) and delivers well-balanced flash exposures thanks to the innovative i-TTL flash control. The built-in flash also offers Commander mode to trigger remote flash units when using Advanced Wireless Lighting. The dual advantages for i-TTL technology and wireless capability make sophisticated remote flash control simple and inspiring. One simple remote flash from the side using the SB-900, SB-700 or SB-600 creates more texture, dimension and mood in ways that available light cannot. For more sophisticated creative effects, the small and intelligent SB-700 has been designed to make the control of remote multiple flashes even easier.Picture Control: PortraitYou can transform the look of an image simply by selecting from the camera&rsquo;s Picture Control menu. Choose from the following settings: Standard, Neutral, Vivid, Monochrome, Landscape, and Portrait. You can even adjust parameters such as sharpness and saturation and then save them as Custom Picture Controls.Optional Multi-Power Battery Pack MB-D11The dedicated battery pack MB-D11 ensures longer battery power.

This stylish and innovative camera will fit perfectly into your active life. Waterproof, shockproof, dustproof, freeze-proof, HD movies, 3D photos, Sweep Panorama, and a touch screen, this powerful tool follows you to the edge and proves you were there.Sony DSC-TX10 Feature HighlightsRugged and StylishThis camera is just as much at home in the water as on a night on the town! The sleek and stylish TX10 fits the slimmest pocket or purse, yet is waterproof to a depth of 16 ft10, shockproof from falls up to approximately 5 ft9and dustproof12thanks to its airtight construction. As well, this durable camera can even withstand extreme weather conditions, as it is operable in temperatures from 14- to 104-degrees Fahrenheit11.&nbsp; Seamlessly shifting from underwater marvels to a night on the town, the TX10 always makes it easy to get the best shot!3-inch Touch screen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large 3-inch touch screen LCD makes it easy for viewing and sharing images with simple and fun touch operation.16.2 Megapixel Back-illuminated &ldquo;Exmor R&rdquo; CMOS Image SensorThe DSC-TX10 features a 16.2 megapixel &ldquo;Exmor R&rdquo; CMOS image sensor that brings out the full resolving power of the camera&rsquo;s Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens to deliver extremely fast speed, high resolution, and stunning low-light sensitivity with improved image clarity and drastically reduced grain. In addition, the combined &ldquo;Exmor R&rdquo; CMOS sensor and BIONZ image processor delivers extremely fast 10fps, Anti Motion Blur, Hand-held Twilight and 1080i movie modes7.Full HD 1080@60i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Record crystal clear movies at the highest resolution available with capabilities for 60i in 1080 Full HD3. This provides stunning, fast motion video with less distortion for playback on your HD TV.3D still image&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Produce awe-inspiring images with 3D still image and 3D Sweep Panorama capabilities. Images will take on a new dimension to view the world in a whole new way5.iSweep Panorama&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With iSweep Panorama just press the shutter, pan the landscape and let the camera do the rest. It automatically links together each frame to produce a panoramic image. This model even detects faces and moving subjects to stitch intelligently different widths to help avoid subject distortion.Background Defocus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DSLR photographs are often beautiful because they blur the background, putting the emphasis on the subject. Now our point-and-shoot cameras can deliver this signature DSLR benefit. The system takes two shots, identifies the background and applies a defocused background keeping the subject crisp and clear.Superior Auto Mode&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The camera automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using backlight correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 36 scenes for still images and movies, making it easy to get the best shot.Soft Skin Mode&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot.&nbsp;Natural Flash&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for far more lifelike images.High speed shootingThe DSC-TX10 can capture full 16.2 megapixel resolution images at up to 10 frames per second, helping to ensure that the decisive moment is captured such as the soccer ball flying into the goal. In addition, the DSC-TX10 employs a mechanical shutter that helps reduce distortion when continuously shooting moving subjects.Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar Lens with 25mm equivalent wide 4x Optical ZoomThe high-performance Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 4x optical zoom lens brings distant subjects closer for video recording as well as for outdoor, sports, and travel photos, and Close Focus shoots close-ups up to just under &frac12;-inch from the subject. A wide angle of 25mm equivalent wide-angle lens allows you to take wider shots of the scene or group in crowded spaces.HDMI output&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a compact audio/video connector interface for transmitting uncompressed digital streams. HDMI connects digital audio/video sources such as a compatible camcorder, Blu-ray Disc player, a personal computer, a video game console, or an AV receiver to a compatible digital audio device and/or video monitor such as a digital television (DTV). Easily connect your Cyber-shot camera via HDMI cable to any compatible HDMI compatible device to easily enjoy and upload content7.Smile Shutter technologySmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. Also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can be used together with Smile Shutter mode.&nbsp; This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting.Face Detection technologySony&rsquo;s Face Detection technology can automatically distinguish between children and adults. Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.Motion DetectionMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces.Anti-blink FunctionIt&rsquo;s frustrating to capture the perfect shot, only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting or blinking. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot.Sweep Multi Angle Mode&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sweep Multi Angle mode, the camera takes 15 images at different angles as it sweeps across the scene. By tilting the camera during playback, the camera&rsquo;s Gyro Sensor detects motion and displays the image in a 3D-like view on the camera&rsquo;s LCD.Anti-Motion Blur ModeCapture cleaner and sharper images in low light for non landscape shots. When set in Anti-motion Blur Mode, the DSC-TX10 captures six images in a fraction of a second with higher shutter speed and combines the data from all six to create a single image of extraordinary detail and dramatically reduce subject blur, beyond the capability of traditional cameras.Backlight Correction HDRShooting high-contrast scenes can often lead to washed out backgrounds and/or details lost in shadow. Backlight Correction HDR helps correct for this by taking three pictures at different exposure settings and processing the best elements of all three into a single image for more natural looking shots.TransferJet technology&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TransferJet technology, developed by Sony and advanced and promoted by consortium of 18 other companies, allows the transfer of up to ten files between two TransferJet enabled devices just by touching their TransferJet logos together, without the hassle of hunting for cables or the complication of pairing8.Compatible with PC and MAC Systems&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Full HD video captured with the DSC-TX10 can be used with the provided Picture Motion Browser software1 for PC and iMovie (sold separately) for Mac systems.Includes Sony PMB (Picture Motion Browser) Software ver. 5.51Sony Picture Motion Browser software offers a simple, intuitive way to transfer, sort, and view your video and still images on your compatible PC.

B004H8FNH6	"Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX10 16.2 MP Waterproof Digital Still Camera with Exmor R CMOS Sensor, 3D Sweep Panorama, and Full HD 1080/60i Video (Blue)"	Electronics	Cameras	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J4jJdM70L._SY300_.jpg	"Sony DSC-TX10The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX10 camera lets you live life on the edge. This stylish and innovative camera will fit perfectly into your active life. Waterproof, shockproof, dustproof, freeze-proof, HD movies, 3D photos, Sweep Panorama, and a touch screen, this powerful tool follows you to the edge and proves you were there.Sony DSC-TX10 Feature HighlightsRugged and StylishThis camera is just as much at home in the water as on a night on the town! The sleek and stylish TX10 fits the slimmest pocket or purse, yet is waterproof to a depth of 16 ft10, shockproof from falls up to approximately 5 ft9and dustproof12thanks to its airtight construction. As well, this durable camera can even withstand extreme weather conditions, as it is operable in temperatures from 14- to 104-degrees Fahrenheit11.&nbsp; Seamlessly shifting from underwater marvels to a night on the town, the TX10 always makes it easy to get the best shot!3-inch Touch screen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large 3-inch touch screen LCD makes it easy for viewing and sharing images with simple and fun touch operation.16.2 Megapixel Back-illuminated &ldquo;Exmor R&rdquo; CMOS Image SensorThe DSC-TX10 features a 16.2 megapixel &ldquo;Exmor R&rdquo; CMOS image sensor that brings out the full resolving power of the camera&rsquo;s Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens to deliver extremely fast speed, high resolution, and stunning low-light sensitivity with improved image clarity and drastically reduced grain. In addition, the combined &ldquo;Exmor R&rdquo; CMOS sensor and BIONZ image processor delivers extremely fast 10fps, Anti Motion Blur, Hand-held Twilight and 1080i movie modes7.Full HD 1080@60i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Record crystal clear movies at the highest resolution available with capabilities for 60i in 1080 Full HD3. This provides stunning, fast motion video with less distortion for playback on your HD TV.3D still image&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Produce awe-inspiring images with 3D still image and 3D Sweep Panorama capabilities. Images will take on a new dimension to view the world in a whole new way5.iSweep Panorama&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With iSweep Panorama just press the shutter, pan the landscape and let the camera do the rest. It automatically links together each frame to produce a panoramic image. This model even detects faces and moving subjects to stitch intelligently different widths to help avoid subject distortion.Background Defocus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DSLR photographs are often beautiful because they blur the background, putting the emphasis on the subject. Now our point-and-shoot cameras can deliver this signature DSLR benefit. The system takes two shots, identifies the background and applies a defocused background keeping the subject crisp and clear.Superior Auto Mode&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The camera automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using backlight correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 36 scenes for still images and movies, making it easy to get the best shot.Soft Skin Mode&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot.&nbsp;Natural Flash&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for far more lifelike images.High speed shootingThe DSC-TX10 can capture full 16.2 megapixel resolution images at up to 10 frames per second, helping to ensure that the decisive moment is captured such as the soccer ball flying into the goal. In addition, the DSC-TX10 employs a mechanical shutter that helps reduce distortion when continuously shooting moving subjects.Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar Lens with 25mm equivalent wide 4x Optical ZoomThe high-performance Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 4x optical zoom lens brings distant subjects closer for video recording as well as for outdoor, sports, and travel photos, and Close Focus shoots close-ups up to just under &frac12;-inch from the subject. A wide angle of 25mm equivalent wide-angle lens allows you to take wider shots of the scene or group in crowded spaces.HDMI output&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a compact audio/video connector interface for transmitting uncompressed digital streams. HDMI connects digital audio/video sources such as a compatible camcorder, Blu-ray Disc player, a personal computer, a video game console, or an AV receiver to a compatible digital audio device and/or video monitor such as a digital television (DTV). Easily connect your Cyber-shot camera via HDMI cable to any compatible HDMI compatible device to easily enjoy and upload content7.Smile Shutter technologySmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. Also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can be used together with Smile Shutter mode.&nbsp; This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting.Face Detection technologySony&rsquo;s Face Detection technology can automatically distinguish between children and adults. Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.Motion DetectionMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces.Anti-blink FunctionIt&rsquo;s frustrating to capture the perfect shot, only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting or blinking. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot.Sweep Multi Angle Mode&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sweep Multi Angle mode, the camera takes 15 images at different angles as it sweeps across the scene. By tilting the camera during playback, the camera&rsquo;s Gyro Sensor detects motion and displays the image in a 3D-like view on the camera&rsquo;s LCD.Anti-Motion Blur ModeCapture cleaner and sharper images in low light for non landscape shots. When set in Anti-motion Blur Mode, the DSC-TX10 captures six images in a fraction of a second with higher shutter speed and combines the data from all six to create a single image of extraordinary detail and dramatically reduce subject blur, beyond the capability of traditional cameras.Backlight Correction HDRShooting high-contrast scenes can often lead to washed out backgrounds and/or details lost in shadow. Backlight Correction HDR helps correct for this by taking three pictures at different exposure settings and processing the best elements of all three into a single image for more natural looking shots.TransferJet technology&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TransferJet technology, developed by Sony and advanced and promoted by consortium of 18 other companies, allows the transfer of up to ten files between two TransferJet enabled devices just by touching their TransferJet logos together, without the hassle of hunting for cables or the complication of pairing8.Compatible with PC and MAC Systems&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Full HD video captured with the DSC-TX10 can be used with the provided Picture Motion Browser software1 for PC and iMovie (sold separately) for Mac systems.Includes Sony PMB (Picture Motion Browser) Software ver. 5.51Sony Picture Motion Browser software offers a simple, intuitive way to transfer, sort, and view your video and still images on your compatible PC.

B004KKZ0J2	Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS3 12.1 MP Rugged/Waterproof Digital Camera with 4.6x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver)	Electronics	Cameras	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ys1-rLDoL._SX300_.jpg	"Panasonic's Lumix DMC-TS3, specifically designed for active users who want to capture high-quality photos and 1920 x 1080 full-High Definition videos, incorporating a powerful rugged design and new outdoor-friendly features, such as a built-in GPS function, a compass, altimeter and barometer.  The new 12.1-megapixel Lumix TS3 further strengthens its toughness, when compared to its Lumix TS2 predecessor,  and is now waterproof to approximately 40 feet (12m); shockproof to approximately 6.6 feet (2m); freezeproof to 14&ordm;F (-10 degrees C); and dustproof.The Panasonic Lumix TS3 also features the new Panasonic 3D Photo mode, which produces a realistic 3D photo by taking 20 consecutive photos and overlays the two best to create a 3D image that can then be played on a Panasonic VIERA 3D HDTV. The format of 3D images is compatible with MPO, and can also be played back on other MPO-compatible equipment such as a televisions, digital photo frames and printers.  Panasonic also adds the Lumix Image Uploader, for seamless and instant sharing via Facebook (for digital photos) or YouTube (for videos). Users can checkmark the photo or video files they want to share, connect it to a PC with the included USB cable or by inserting the SD Memory Card directly into the PC's SD Card slot, and then the uploading automatically launches with an easy-to-follow menu option.The Panasonic Lumix TS3 features a 28mm wide-angle Leica DC Vario-Elmar lens, complete with a folded optics design. With an optical zoom up to 4.6x, the Lumix TS3 works even while shooting video--giving the user the flexibility for a variety of different scenes--especially underwater, where movement is often restricted and the angle of view becomes important for composing shots.  Thanks to the newly incorporated Intelligent Resolution technology, the Intelligent Zoom is available and extends the zoom to 6x equivalent.Empowered by a newly developed 12.1-megapixel Hi-Speed CCD sensor, the Lumix TS3 is compatible with high-speed, large-capacity signal processing required for 1920 x 1080 full-HD AVCHD video recording and high speed continuous shooting. The advanced image processor, the Venus Engine FHD, powers Panasonic's Intelligent Resolution and the Sonic Speed AF, allows for a shutter release time lag as short as approximately 0.005 second. Beyond full-HD video recording capabilities, Lumix TS3 excels in shooting videos with a Dolby Digital Creator so audio quality is also high.  The built-in LED light greatly supports shooting in dark situations. The Lumix TS3 also features a 2.7-inch, 230,000-dot Intelligent LCD screen with wide-viewing angle and Anti-Reflection coating.Panasonic's iA Mode, a suite of technologies that engage automatically, has evolved for more powerful image stabilization while video recording and taking still photos with Active Mode which boosts POWER OIS to excel in suppressing blur when recording videos at wide angle while walking. Other features of iA include: POWER OIS, Face Recognition, Face Detection, AF Tracking, Intelligent ISO Control, Intelligent Scene Selector and Intelligent Exposure. With iA, taking beautiful photos is possible for users at any skill level. In addition, the Intelligent Resolution technology is always activated in the iA mode, which helps produce even clearer photos by precisely performing signal processing pixel by pixel to help ensure clear and sharp images.The newly-integrated GPS function shows the name of the Country/Region, State/Prov./County, County/Township, City/Town/Village and Landmark by using the internal data to give users details on where the photos or videos were taken.  The area information covers 203 countries or regions for global users. Plus, more than 1,000,000 landmarks over 78 countries or regions are in the database. Using the included software PHOTOfunSTUDIO 6.1 HD Lite Edition, photos and videos can be searched by location and names. The Lumix TS3 also features an internal clock that automatically adjusts to the local time when GPS is enabled--a handy feature for travelers.Panasonic Lumix TS3 Highlights3D Photo ModeThe newly added 3D Photo Mode*produces a 3D image in the camera. The image-processing method used by LUMIX records beautiful images with less distortion or visible image links. Take 20 panning shots and the camera automatically selects the two most suitable images--one for the right eye and one for the left eye--to synthesize a 3D composite.The 3D image can be viewed on a VIERA HDTV. The 3D image format is compatible with MPO, so it can be played back on other MPO-compatible equipment such as TVs and digital photo frames, or printed.*The picture size is fixed to 2-megapixel (16:9)3D Image Viewer/VIERA LinkPhotos or movies recorded in AVCHD on the SD/SDHC/SDXC Memory Cards are easy to view on a Panasonic VIERA TV. Simply insert the card into the VIERA Image Viewer (SD/SDHC/SDXC Memory Card slot) on VIERA TV or DIGA Blu-ray Disc Player to playback your contents. Alternatively, you can use an optional HDMI micro cable to output the still and motion images you took from the DMC-TS3 directly to the TV for VIERA Link. Most of the control is possible using only the TV's remote control.Leica DC LensThe DMC-TS3 features a high-quality LEICA DC VARIO-ELMAR 28mm wide-angle lens with a 4.6x optical zoom (35mm camera equivalent: 28-128mm). The folded optics of shaft guide method is adopted to secure the toughness of the lens unit. This lens unit comprises 10 elements and a prism unit in 8 groups, including an ED lens and 5 aspherical lenses with 6 aspherical surfaces passing the Leica's stringent standards to deliver exceptional optical performance to the edges.The DMC-TS3 is drop proof from a height up to 2.0m in accordance with the ""MIL-STD 810F Method516.5-Shock"" test standard. In addition to reinforcing the exterior of the camera with shock-resistant material, the DMC-TS3 uses folded optics to prevent its lens unit from taking damage when dropped during operation. The lens unit is protected by a supplementary damper to absorb the force from shock impact. All components including the lens unit are reexamined to endure the temperature as low as -10 degrees C to make the DMC-TS3 freezeproof.2.7-inch high-resolution LCDThe DMC-TS3's large 2.7-inch LCD features a high 230,000-dot resolution, and a wide-viewing angle that lets you frame your shot in a variety of ways for both shooting and viewing. LUMIX's acclaimed Intelligent LCD function also automatically adjusts the brightness in 11 steps according to shooting conditions. In addition, the AR (anti-reflective) coating LCD minimizes glare and provides clear images, for high visibility even in outdoor brightness.This LCD provides sharp, clear images in virtually all shooting situations, ranging from nighttime to bright daylight scenes and from low-angle to high-angle shooting. And it lets you share the fun of viewing images with family and friends.Lumix Image UploaderThe DMC-TS3 gives you a new form of communication by letting you share your photos and movies. All you have to do is checkmark the photos and movies you want to share and connect the camera or SD/SDHC/SDXC Memory Card to a computer. Uploading automatically starts by simply following the guidance. It's easy to share photos and movies on the spot, which means that your friends don't have to wait for you to come back home to see them."	4471	Panasonic	253.00

B004RPUK0Y	Orb Audio QuickPack - Metallic Black Gloss	Electronics	Speaker Systems	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BwDHhyGIL._SX300_.jpg	"Looking for a pair of small speakers for clean, detailed sound in a small to medium room? Orb Audio's Mod1 Quick Pack brings audiophile home speaker quality to your stereo or home theater system. This package features two of Orb Audio's award-winning Mod1 Satellite Speakers and a basic desk stand allowing the speaker to rest on a table or shelf. It is the perfect solution if you want big sound from a small, attractive package. Each Orb speaker is less than 4.25 inches in diameter and packs a custom, state of the art full range speaker driver. While the round speaker shape is pleasing to the eye, it also offers superior acoustic properties - the perfect embodiment of form following function. Dialogue and vocals have excellent presence and music enjoys a rich reproduction that rivals much larger speakers. Orb Audio speakers are made in America from carbon steel and feature a variety of metallic and powder coated finishes that will complement any decor. Orb Audio's no-compromise approach to speaker design is also apparent with their use of neodymium magnets, oxygen-free internal wire and gold plated brass binding posts.

A full 24 x 36mm, the sensor captures 5184 x 3456 large individual 6.95 &micro;m pixels and has a much-improved S/N ratio resulting in better images from the start. A new photodiode structure with an increased photoelectric conversion rate increases the sensor&#x2019;s sensitivity by approximately 2 stops over previous models, meaning higher ISOs with the lowest noise of any EOS digital camera. And a 2-line 16-channel simultaneous signal readout means speeds of up to 12 fps (RAW + JPEG) and even 14 fps (Super High Speed Mode) are possible!Dual DIGIC 5+ Image Processors for enhanced noise reduction and blazing processing speedFor a whole new level of performance, the EOS-1D X uses Dual DIGIC 5+ Image Processors.

You get four satellite speakers and a center channel speaker for the mid- and high-range audio signals, plus an 8-Inch powered subwoofer to handle the low frequencies. All the speakers come with an attractive black finish and convenient spring-loaded signal connectors. The center speakers use two 3-Inch shielded mid-range cones, while the satellites employ one 3-Inch cone and a 1/2-Inch dome tweeter. However, don't let the small size fool you! These 8 ohm speakers will handle up to 125 watts of power from your home theater receiver at frequencies from 150 Hz to 20 kHz. The subwoofer is powered by a 60 watt (RMS) amplifier, driving a downward firing 8-Inch cone. It can take either line or speaker-level inputs, so can be used with any amplifier, even older amps without dedicated subwoofer outputs. The subwoofer handles frequencies between 50 Hz to 250 Hz and includes adjustable crossover frequency and volume balance controls. Also included in the box are four C brackets for mounting the satellite speakers to the wall and the necessary hardware for mounting the speakers to the brackets. A pair of plastic feet to properly orient the face of the center speaker is also included. Note that you will need to provide your own hardware for mounting the C brackets to the wall or other vertical surface. Don't let the low price fool you! This speaker system sounds great and will fill your room with high-quality, full-spectrum sound! Note: The speaker wire connectors on each unit comfortably accept a maximum 16 gauge speaker wire. For best results use pin-type speaker plugs to make the speaker connections and banana or pin-type plugs to connect the wires to your amplifier."	24195	Monoprice	99.99

B0082OJ2VE	Pentax K-30 Weather-Sealed 16 MP CMOS Digital SLR with 18-55mm Lens (Black)	Electronics	Digital SLR Cameras	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51am3d77MHL._SX300_.jpg	"Thanks to the K-30, for the first time in a long time location doesn't matter. Whether it's a sandy day at the beach or a trek into the wet rainforests of Belize, the K-30 is the ideal DSLR camera to capture your memories regardless of your location or the elements you face. Its 16 megapixel sensor and full 1080P HD video capabilities coupled with a fully weather sealed, dustproof and coldproof, ergonomic body, give you the flexibility and comfortability to shoot what you want, when you want and where you want.Weather resistant design ideal for travel and outdoor photographyFeaturing 81 seals set in its compact, lightweight, portable body, the K-30 is built to be weather, dust and cold resistant with proven functionality in sub-freezing temperatures as low as 14&deg;F (-10&deg;C). Its exterior has been designed to be both sporty and functional for active outdoor photographers &ndash; a large grip provides a firm, secure hold of the camera; a low-profile pentaprism housing for reduced height; and a rounded, soft-rubber casing for a solid grip of the camera during vertical shooting.Newly developed SAFOX IXi+ Autofocus (AF) module for improved autofocus performanceThe K-30 features the new state-of-the-art SAFOX IXi+ AF sensor module, which assures responsive, high-precision autofocus operation by incorporating a diffraction lens to minimize chromatic aberration in accordance to the characteristics of each individual lens. A dedicated sensor also factors the light source into its calculations at the time of shooting. Additionally, 9 of its 11 focus points have cross-type sensors to capture subjects in sharp focus, while a spotbeam assists the AF system during low light situations. The K-30's AF algorithm has also been upgraded in all areas for efficiency and accuracy. A new expanded area AF function allows the sensor module to continue to track a moving subject in AF select mode, even when it moves out of a pre-assigned auto-tracking area, by assessing distance data collected by neighboring focus sensors. This greatly improves the accuracy and speed of detecting moving subjects during autofocus shooting, and autofocusing performance when using a telephoto lens.High resolution, low noise, true-to-life image reproductionThe K-30 incorporates the latest 16 megapixel APS-C sized CMOS image sensor with a large image-capturing area measuring 23.7mm by 15.7mm. It assures high speed image data readout to deliver super high resolution, rich gradation digital images with approximately 16.28 effective megapixels. This image sensor is coupled in the K-30 with the PENTAX &ldquo;PRIME M&rdquo; imaging engine for outstanding full 1080p HD movie clips (1920x1080 pixels at 30 frames per second), in addition to outstanding still image capture processing. The camera also minimizes luminance noise at low sensitivities, while offering a wide sensitivity range between ISO 100 and ISO 12800 (ISO 25600 maximum when expanded via a custom function).Optical finder with 100% field of viewDespite its compact body, which is smaller and lighter than traditional mid level DSLR camera models, the K-30 comes equipped with a glass pentaprism finder featuring a 100% field of view and approximately 0.92X maximum magnification (with a 50mm f/1.4 lens at infinity) to cover the entire field of view for easy focusing and framing. Since its viewfinder delivers a clear view of the subject even in the brightest sunshine while also eliminating parallax, the K-30 responds efficiently and reliably to demanding applications and subjects, such as landscapes requiring delicate, high-precision framing, and sports scenes where the timing of shutter release is critical. The K-30 also accepts interchangeable PENTAX Natural-Bright-Matte III focusing screens to facilitate manual focusing operation. Optional focus screens include cross-lined and scale types, to accommodate more specialized applications.High-speed burst shooting at approximately six images per secondWhen photographing sporting events, concerts or wildlife, the K-30's high-speed burst shooting function comes in handy, allowing the photographer to capture active, fast moving subjects in a series of images at a maximum speed of approximately 6 frames per second (in JPEG format).Advanced Live View shootingThanks to the latest CMOS image sensor and PRIME M engine, the K-30 offers a clear, true-to-life Live View at a smooth 60 frames per second. It also features a focus peaking function during live view to improve manual focusing speed and accuracy. Live View on the K-30 also offers a choice of three grid display patterns including a Golden Section overlay, and detailed information overlay if desired by the photographer.High quality video recordingThe PENTAX K-30 features full HD video recording to capture high quality movie clips in 1080p resolution (1920x1080 pixels). The efficient h.264 compression format offers a choice of frame rates (30, 25 or 24 frames per second) at 1080p, or up to 60 FPS at 720p, to accommodate user specific applications. Video recording options are flexible, allowing the photographer to select aperture or shutter exposure control, while PENTAX Shake Reduction helps stabilize captured video. Users may add creative artistic effects to recorded clips using various Custom Image modes or record subjects in a series of video clips with the Interval Movie Shooting mode.User friendly Auto Picture and Scene modesThe K-30 features the PENTAX-original Auto Picture mode, which analyzes a scene then automatically selects the most appropriate shooting mode from Portrait, Landscape, Macro as well as others. This allows the photographer to concentrate on image composition and other creative elements while leaving more technical settings to the K-30, such as shutter speed, aperture, white balance, saturation, contrast and sharpness. The K-30 also offers 19 creative Scene modes, including Night Scene Portrait, Pet, Backlight Silhouette, and more, to simplify photographing unique subjects and scenes that often require uncommon camera settings.PENTAX Shake Reduction (SR) mechanism for sharp, blur free imagesThe PENTAX K-30 incorporates the PENTAX-developed SR mechanism, which effectively reduces blur due to camera shake by approximately four shutter steps. Usable with all PENTAX compatible lenses*, including those produced for film format SLR cameras, this mechanism produces sharp, blur free images even under demanding conditions that are prone to camera shake, such as when using a telephoto lens, shooting in the dark without flash illumination, or capturing landscapes in twilight. The K-30's SR system also offers several other useful features to assist the photographer during shooting, including an Automatic Horizon Correction function to assure high precision image framing and effortless adjustment of horizontal alignment, a Composition Adjustment function to allow minute adjustments of image alignment horizontally/vertically/axially, and an ASTROTRACER mode to eliminate light trails during astronomical photography in combination with the optional O-GPS1 GPS Unit (available separately).* Lenses compatible with this mechanism: PENTAX K-, KA-, KAF-, KAF2- and KAF3-mount lenses; screw-mount lenses (with an adapter); and 645- and 67-system lenses (with an adapter). Some functions may not be available with certain lenses.A selection of image processing tools for creative, personalized expressionThe K-30 features a Custom Image function, which allows the user to easily and quickly select the desired finishing touch for a particular image. Choose from 11 custom settings including Bleach Bypass that creates a dramatic visual effect similar to that used in motion pictures, and Cross Process to produce fanciful, eye-catching images boasting dramatic colors. The K-30 also offers a choice of 19 creative digital filters including Miniature, which transforms an actual scene into what appears to be an image of miniature models. These filters add distinctive visual effects to captured images producing creative, artistic images without the need for a computer. The user can further expand the creative possibilities by applying multiple filters and processing modes to a single image.Choice of two power sourcesIn addition to the included lithium ion battery capable of capturing approximately 480 images with a single charge**, the K-30 can also be powered by four AA-size batteries using the optional D-BH109 AA Battery Holder. Since AA batteries can be easily obtained almost anywhere around the world, there's no worry about battery shortages, even when shooting for an extended period of time or in remote locations.** Under testing conditions prescribed by PENTAX, using the D-LI109 Rechargeable Lithium-ion Battery with no flash discharges.Additional features include:Large, wide angle viewable 3-inch LCD monitor with approximately 921,000 dots of resolution77 segment multi-pattern metering system for accurate light measurementDR (Dust Removal) mechanism to shake dust off from the surface of the CMOS image sensorPENTAX-designed Hyper control system to assure fast and flexible response to the photographer's creative intentionsDynamic range expansion function to compensate for blown out (overexposed) and muddy (underexposed) areas of an imageRetrieve and save RAW data from buffer memory for a just-recorded JPEG imageRAW/Fx multi-function button for on-the-fly switching of image file formats, as well as for assignment and instant recall of other specific functionsSILKYPIX Developer Studio 3.0 for PENTAX (RAW processing engine developed by Ichikawa Soft Laboratory) included"	3897	Pentax	698.85

The RM222 features efficient operation, small size and a lightweight design for mounting flexibility. It can even be mounted in the hot-shoe on top of your camera. The RM222 features 2 locking XLR inputs with low-noise microphone preamplifiers. Each channel includes a Mic/Line level switch, a Hi/Lo gain switch and a Phantom power switch. The onboard Phantom power voltage is selectable between 48V/12V. The inputs can also be summed mono, copying each input to both sides. The right channel can be completely powered down to conserve battery power if not needed.When engaged, the Audio Output Bracketing feature of the RM222 ensures that your audio inputs won't clip or distort. By placing the RM222's performance in mono and enabling the 16dB pad on the right channel, you end up with two signals with identical content, yet the right is recorded 16dB lower. This way if a sudden loud noise or a boomy portion of audio is recorded, you'll have a backup track with headroom in case the 0dB output clips. The RM222 Riggy-Micro uses a 9V battery. High capacity lithium-polymer rechargeable batteries can be used as well as alkaline. The low-battery indicator can be switched between alkaline or lithium-polymer threshold, so you can use either chemistry without leaving unnecessary capacity in the bat"	39717	JuicedLink	81.00

So from outside, it looks just like someone is home watching TV.  Most burglars do not target occupied houses.  Why risk prison?  So when a prowler sees that flickering glow that means someone is home watching TV, he knows to move on to an easier target. So, FakeTV makes a break-in less likely.  Our new model FTV-11 is three times brighter than our model FTV-10.FakeTV's built-in computer controls 12 super-bright LEDs that fill a room with light.  It accurately simulates scene changes, fades, and on-screen motion, in thousand of possible shades of color, just like real TV.  A built-in light sensor turns FakeTV on at dusk, and it can be set to turn off after four or seven hours.  The dynamic light from FakeTV conveys the impression of ""alive"" in a way that a light on a timer cannot.  Consumes just the power of a night light.

The formulation of the filter permits the proper infusion time by regulating the filtration rate - not to slow, not too fast. Good infusion of the coffee grounds (as in brewing and steeping tea) gives coffee a richer flavor while at the same time making possible precise fractional extraction: filtering out the undesirable components which make coffee bitter by allowing only the desirable flavor elements of the coffee bean to pass through.The Chemex filter is folded into a cone shape, exactly as in laboratory techniques. This assures uniform extraction since the water filters through all the grounds on its way to the apex of the cone. The Chemex filter is guaranteed not to burst under the weight of the liquid during filtration, and not to break when lifting out the grounds.Fully-bodied, richer flavor, from less coffee, and as strong as you like without bitterness - that's what the Chemex filter gives you."	392	Chemex	13.25
